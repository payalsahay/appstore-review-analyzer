Also, why do I need to login to an HP account to use a 15+ year old device sitting on my own desk? Why can't I scan at 600dpi or greater?

For example, if I want page 5 only, neither writing 5 or 5-5 prints page 5, and the printer will print page 1. Also, the app has improved from its previous versions, but the printers are buggy, don't wake up when a job is sent, and the cleaning cycles take ages making them useless for quick jobs (officeJet).",20.2.0.6076,2026-01-11T12:12:52,in,en,5

cfd4fdd2-ab1d-404f-bb05-fd69f76b1662,Dave Nicolai,2,"2 stars because it does technically allow me to scan and there are no Android alternatives for my HP AIO. This app is more of an advertisement/upsell effort by HP than a print & scan app. Close all the ads? They all come back seconds later. Also, why do I need to login to an HP account to use a 15+ year old device sitting on my own desk? Why can't I scan at 600dpi or greater? Before installing, check to see if your device is supported by the ""Mopria"" app so you can hopefully steer clear of this.",18.10.0.5530,2026-01-17T20:04:55,sg,en,0

It is one of the best mobile scanning documents to convert your physical documents to jpeg or pdf. It has never failed to impress me. It is also packed with superb functionalities to use your HP printer. Everything can be done from this HP Printer Smart app. Highly recommending it to anyone willing to get a scanning document app or if you are buying a HP printer on 2026, you will definitely need this app to setup your HP printer =)",,2026-01-17T17:40:00,sg,en,0

I paid for 4 months of it and printed so little I never needed a ink cartridge to be sent out. I decided I didnt need it any more.
