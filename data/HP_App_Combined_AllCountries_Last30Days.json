I said I just want to cancel. They told me I would pay $200 to cancel and if I wait till next month which I would have had it for a year then I would pay $100. These people are crooks. If you do not print on a regular basis, this program to lease, a printer from them is a joke and you are wasting your money.",

They even have a package to send back your old used cartridges. The best part is the printer was very inexpensive brand new. I have the HP OfficeJet 5255. I will always buy HP printers.",

I didn’t realize just how easily this connects to your HP printer and we’ve had our printer for years so I’m impressed with the backwards compatibility. An even nicer surprise was that I was able to fax a document directly from this app right after scanning it. I just happened to stumble upon that feature after just the day before looking for apps that would allow for free faxing. Very impressed and I like how the scanning feature shows a live updated document while the scan is occurring.",

I’ve had my printer for several years and it had always worked ok, once I got it setup. As a matter of fact, it worked better on my desktop than my iPad. Now it is the opposite. I have Norton 360 on all my devices and have turned off all the protection such as the two VPN’s built in. It doesn’t matter. I use my printer all the time. Now it is a big paper weight. Thanks for all the new features I can’t use. I can’t use it at all now.",

Having to login to check ink levels or make printer adjustments is inconvenient.  Pop up adds promoting the easy ink program is annoying too. No tutorial after major app updates.  My access to select my photos is buried below other folders so it does not show up on. my screen.  So you have to scroll down to see it.  At first I didn’t know there was other folders below what was on the screen so I could find my photos folder so I didn’t use the iPad app.  It was only after another app update that I noticed upon loading that it showed all the folders then resized to show only a few folders on my screen. so I tried scrolling down and found my photos folder. I’ve had this printer for 5 years and when it breaks down I will be looking at other brands.",

It’s so frustrating when developers just move forward with a lesser product in the name of “new update” and don’t give the user the ability to keep the original version. I may change out my printer to a different manufacturer due to this issue. I do a lot of scanning and editing and this last update has made cropping unusable for me.  Just disappointing.

    "content": "If there was a case study on how bad a product can be, this should be one of the fine examples. Here are my findings for future scholars. \n1. Asks for subscriptions one too many times - this is a printer and a scanner, which blocks you from using anything other than their sub-par ink to print anything and you are asked to pay them money every month\n2. Why do i need an account to scan my document? There is literally no logical reason to need an account for a scan job. \n3. Scan at 300DPI when my machine supports 1200DPI. Imagine you spent $100 on a high quality camera that can shoot at 48 megapixel, but the app, the only way to take the photo, delivers the product in 12 megapixel. Gameboy camera kit had a better resolution than this joke. \n4. Constantly disconnects after a scan job. Whoever designed the firmware clearly has no business in embedded software engineering if they can’t keep a connection alive. \n5. Apple human interface guideline is ignored in every chance. You guys clearly thought you had better UX than Apple guideline, which isn’t perfect, but light years better than this UX, designed when Germans were still flying overhead",

So very excited about the things that I can actually do with it. Was definitely worth the money got it on sale for Christmas it’s going to save me money but also the money I would spend on getting them developed now I can put that money toward getting the paper that I need to print my pictures and depending on size the paper it’s self can be pricey but the money that I spend in a month from getting them developed I can buy the photo paper almost 4 time for it to add up what I spend a month on getting them developed it’s my kids I take pics of so of course I’m get them developed because to me that’s memories that I have of my children birthday first day of school whatever got to do it while there young that way I always have the memories of my kids been a certain age or whatever .",

Installed in just a few minutes, working great. 6 months later some updates were notified and acted upon. Since then, my printer rarely responds, will not direct print and takes a lifetime. Hopefully just a short term glitch so I can go back to being HP’s biggest fan once more.",

The last one stopped working and trying to problem solve it was a night mate in the end I just gave up and bought a new one. It came with free ink. Hp continued to charge me for instant ink despite having not been able to print anything and I figured it made sense to use the free ink I got with it. It also came with a 3 month free instant ink however upon setting up the printer it asks me to setup hp + and today’s that after I do I won’t be able to use instant ink. The whole thing is a confusing mess and not user friendly at all. The app is so glitchy so expect hours to be wasted staring at a loading symbol and getting instantly kicked out and having to constantly re log in to it. There was no answer on the customer support line. I waited and eventually just got cut off. I would not recommendHP!",

Einfach nichts ist perfekt und für meinen Geschmack könnte die App noch ein paar mehr Detailliertere Einstellungen anbieten ähnlich der Windows Applikation.  Zudem könnte man die Einstellungen ggf. Übersichtlicher/Zentraler gestalten. Beispiel beim Scannen befinden sich die Einstellungen auf unterschiedlichen Buttons statt das Menü in Menü zu gestalten. Eine Möglichkeit vermisse ich noch oder habe dies noch nicht gefunden… Wenn man Scannt mit der App und mehrere nicht zusammenhängende Seiten Scannt fehlt mir die Möglichkeit vor dem speichern manuell die Dateien zu trennen so das man mit einem Scann mehrere Dateien speichern kann. Aber dennoch alles was ich bisher gebraucht habe mit Ausnahme des einen was oben beschrieben wurde ist die App Top !",

Mark my words it will test your patience forever and ever. The app constantly disconnects, refuses to recognize the printer, fails basic tasks, and turns something as simple as printing into a full-time job. I spent more time troubleshooting than actually printing. If you value your time, sanity, or mental health, stay far away. I genuinely regret this purchase.",

    "content": "I spent more than 5 hours trying to make a basic HP printer work. Printing and even standalone copying are completely blocked, although the hardware is fine. HP is forcing users into a monthly Instant Ink subscription by locking cartridges via software. Firmware updates, resets and support suggestions do nothing, because this is not a bug, it’s a business decision. This feels deceptive and exhausting. A printer should print, not require subscriptions to function.",
