I was not using the printer at all, even though it comes with where they sent you out replacement ink cartridges so last month I downgraded and they still charged me for the regular amount and I was told that they will do one more month before they downgrade you. I said I just want to cancel. They told me I would pay $200 to cancel and if I wait till next month which I would have had it for a year then I would pay $100. These people are crooks. If you do not print on a regular basis, this program to lease, a printer from them is a joke and you are wasting your money.",

HP is a good brand of computer and a good brand of printer, but maybe they should focus making ink and paper and automated thing through a monthly subscription service and more on just making their products more cheap cheaper.",

I didn’t realize just how easily this connects to your HP printer and we’ve had our printer for years so I’m impressed with the backwards compatibility. An even nicer surprise was that I was able to fax a document directly from this app right after scanning it. I just happened to stumble upon that feature after just the day before looking for apps that would allow for free faxing. Very impressed and I like how the scanning feature shows a live updated document while the scan is occurring.",

I’ve had my printer for several years and it had always worked ok, once I got it setup. As a matter of fact, it worked better on my desktop than my iPad. Now it is the opposite. I have Norton 360 on all my devices and have turned off all the protection such as the two VPN’s built in. It doesn’t matter. I use my printer all the time. Now it is a big paper weight. Thanks for all the new features I can’t use. I can’t use it at all now.",

Having to login to check ink levels or make printer adjustments is inconvenient.  Pop up adds promoting the easy ink program is annoying too. No tutorial after major app updates.  My access to select my photos is buried below other folders so it does not show up on. my screen.  So you have to scroll down to see it.  At first I didn’t know there was other folders below what was on the screen so I could find my photos folder so I didn’t use the iPad app.  It was only after another app update that I noticed upon loading that it showed all the folders then resized to show only a few folders on my screen. so I tried scrolling down and found my photos folder. I’ve had this printer for 5 years and when it breaks down I will be looking at other brands.",

Asks for subscriptions one too many times - this is a printer and a scanner, which blocks you from using anything other than their sub-par ink to print anything and you are asked to pay them money every month\n2. Why do i need an account to scan my document? There is literally no logical reason to need an account for a scan job. \n3. Scan at 300DPI when my machine supports 1200DPI. Imagine you spent $100 on a high quality camera that can shoot at 48 megapixel, but the app, the only way to take the photo, delivers the product in 12 megapixel. Gameboy camera kit had a better resolution than this joke. \n4. Constantly disconnects after a scan job. Whoever designed the firmware clearly has no business in embedded software engineering if they can’t keep a connection alive. \n5. Apple human interface guideline is ignored in every chance. You guys clearly thought you had better UX than Apple guideline, which isn’t perfect, but light years better than this UX, designed when Germans were still flying overhead",

Hp continued to charge me for instant ink despite having not been able to print anything and I figured it made sense to use the free ink I got with it. It also came with a 3 month free instant ink however upon setting up the printer it asks me to setup hp + and today’s that after I do I won’t be able to use instant ink. The whole thing is a confusing mess and not user friendly at all. The app is so glitchy so expect hours to be wasted staring at a loading symbol and getting instantly kicked out and having to constantly re log in to it. There was no answer on the customer support line. I waited and eventually just got cut off. I would not recommendHP!",

Eine Möglichkeit vermisse ich noch oder habe dies noch nicht gefunden… Wenn man Scannt mit der App und mehrere nicht zusammenhängende Seiten Scannt fehlt mir die Möglichkeit vor dem speichern manuell die Dateien zu trennen so das man mit einem Scann mehrere Dateien speichern kann. Aber dennoch alles was ich bisher gebraucht habe mit Ausnahme des einen was oben beschrieben wurde ist die App Top !",

So I got the refillable ink Epson printer and have printed literally hundreds of pages and the ink has barely went down! Sure it's not cheap to buy but it's going to last forever! Best decision I've ever made regarding printing. Just wanted to share the solution. Goodbye HP!",

This app is more of an advertisement/upsell effort by HP than a print & scan app. Close all the ads? They all come back seconds later. Also, why do I need to login to an HP account to use a 15+ year old device sitting on my own desk? Why can't I scan at 600dpi or greater? Before installing, check to see if your device is supported by the \"Mopria\" app so you can hopefully steer clear of this.",
