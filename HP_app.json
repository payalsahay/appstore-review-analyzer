I forget the network and re-sign in to the Wi-Fi. It still has an error exclamation over the Wi-Fi and does not work. I have to have the printer turned off sometimes for a week straight to get it to reset. Then the HP smart app on Windows cannot will not show that I have the printer connected through USB so I have to download party app to use the scanner because the HP smart app can’t find a plugged in printer to my computer. I will always never recommend an HP printer. Not for quality of print for the inability to print.",

Having to login to check ink levels or make printer adjustments is inconvenient.  Pop up adds promoting the easy ink program is annoying too. No tutorial after major app updates.  My access to select my photos is buried below other folders so it does not show up on. my screen.  So you have to scroll down to see it.  At first I didn’t know there was other folders below what was on the screen so I could find my photos folder so I didn’t use the iPad app.  It was only after another app update that I noticed upon loading that it showed all the folders then resized to show only a few folders on my screen. so I tried scrolling down and found my photos folder. I’ve had this printer for 5 years and when it breaks down I will be looking at other brands.",

I called them (support is very challenging), and was told they could support but I had to pay a fee just to talk to someone.  Said no thanks and bought another hp printer (out of spite because I’m an idiot).\n\nAbout 30 days after the warranty was up is stopped connecting and hasn’t worked since.\n\nAlmost seems like it’s planned………..",

I may change out my printer to a different manufacturer due to this issue. I do a lot of scanning and editing and this last update has made cropping unusable for me.  Just disappointing.

    "content": "If there was a case study on how bad a product can be, this should be one of the fine examples. Here are my findings for future scholars. \n1. Asks for subscriptions one too many times - this is a printer and a scanner, which blocks you from using anything other than their sub-par ink to print anything and you are asked to pay them money every month\n2. Why do i need an account to scan my document? There is literally no logical reason to need an account for a scan job. \n3. Scan at 300DPI when my machine supports 1200DPI. Imagine you spent $100 on a high quality camera that can shoot at 48 megapixel, but the app, the only way to take the photo, delivers the product in 12 megapixel. Gameboy camera kit had a better resolution than this joke. \n4. Constantly disconnects after a scan job. Whoever designed the firmware clearly has no business in embedded software engineering if they can’t keep a connection alive. \n5. Apple human interface guideline is ignored in every chance. You guys clearly thought you had better UX than Apple guideline, which isn’t perfect, but light years better than this UX, designed when Germans were still flying overhead",

If I don’t hear back from someone at HP explaining why this new process is necessary, let alone better, I will never ever buy an HP product EVER again and will do what I can to ensure others abide by the same.

So I already have a lot that I have had to pay for. Now I can start doing my scrapbooks again. I love it so far like I said works very good. Also just started to play around with it today. So very excited about the things that I can actually do with it. Was definitely worth the money got it on sale for Christmas it’s going to save me money but also the money I would spend on getting them developed now I can put that money toward getting the paper that I need to print my pictures and depending on size the paper it’s self can be pricey but the money that I spend in a month from getting them developed I can buy the photo paper almost 4 time for it to add up what I spend a month on getting them developed it’s my kids I take pics of so of course I’m get them developed because to me that’s memories that I have of my children birthday first day of school whatever got to do it while there young that way I always have the memories of my kids been a certain age or whatever .",

The problem with that is there’s no lock because some of the images are way bigger that I need to print in multiple sheets to make my stencils so there needs to be a lock on that because once you move it, it’ll adjust the size now with the new update when you select the printer you have to select it multiple times like way over four times Before it will connect to the printer. And it happens not only to be, but to multiple people I work with then when you do go to resize and you get it to the size you want and hit print it’ll reset then you have to go resize it again and hit print again twice and it happens every single time so fix those issues before you’re messing with making the screen black or whatever you want make the right changes.",

    "content": "this new update made my small business grind to a screeching halt today, for hours!  i had just got started printing out a batch of invoices when suddenly my printer seemed to virtually ‘disappear’ and i could not figure out how to remedy the process.  the print function was disabled and said that there was not a printer available while the app said the printer was awake and all is well.  i finally figured out i had to click on the export icon then select print by app.  by the time it actually starts printing i have made a total of 5 EXTRA clicks.  and then another 4 clicks after the print job is completed before i can start the next.  this has doubled the amount of time i used to take just to print invoices.  one other feature on the newly updated app that i do not see available is the option to increase or decrease the image size.  for example i need to be able to decrease the size from 100% to 90% so that a 2 page print job will fit on 1 page.   and i need to decrease to 75% for my usps postage labels to fit nicely on my packages.  i REALLY NEED this feature and if i can figure out how to connect to the printer w my ipad without this app, i will.  so far all it is doing is pissing me off.",

The older version was clear, easy to use and helpful, but NOT THIS iteration. Shame on HP for doing this. DISGUSTING!",

Hp continued to charge me for instant ink despite having not been able to print anything and I figured it made sense to use the free ink I got with it. It also came with a 3 month free instant ink however upon setting up the printer it asks me to setup hp + and today’s that after I do I won’t be able to use instant ink. The whole thing is a confusing mess and not user friendly at all. The app is so glitchy so expect hours to be wasted staring at a loading symbol and getting instantly kicked out and having to constantly re log in to it. There was no answer on the customer support line. I waited and eventually just got cut off. I would not recommendHP!",

    "content": "The one thing it should do it can’t. Detect ink levels. Just changed cartridge with the instant ink sent to me by hp. The app has no idea what the levels are. The app does loads of other stuff, useless if it can’t do the basics.  So often, the app cannot detect the printer, even though the printer won’t even switch off.  I’ve unplugged the printer as it is slightly less annoying if I pretend it doesn’t exist.  The set up process is flawed: the set up instructions in the app quick setup are woefully incorrect, and the app tries to register the printer with HP even when it is not connected to the internet yet.  Does anyone at HP care about making this app work properly?  Embarrasing.",

I couldn’t believe it when I was billed £20.00 for printing a few pages of my OWN paper. The customer “service” is effin useless, too.  Just takes you to a GPT bot and doesn’t offer the option to speak with a real person. I’m afraid this is the last straw with HP, Cancelled my membership and shan’t be returning. \n\nTake my advice and get the standard ink cartridges. They don’t make it obvious that this is even an option.

I had to download an App to every device which used different methods to communicate to the printer.\nIt seems that the Software teams deliberately make life more difficult year on year.

    "title": "What's with the ZOMBIE app HP.",
    "content": "UPDATE : I had to delete the app and reinstall as it was consuming 50% battery life when the iPad Pro was in standby.  The app has Background activity turned off, (I have it turned off by default for all apps) yet it still manages to be in the background for 8 hours a night and throughout the day.  I have not run the app in a week, and then it suddenly pops up in the battery monitor as a background task running all night and all day.  All AI options for the app are also disabled, yet it still keeps using battery life whilst doing nothing.  So I have had to delete it again. There are also the frequent crashes after scanning, this software is no longer as reliable for making PDFs as it used to be.  HP used to be known for their quality, but not so much now.\n\nI guess I only have myself to blame for trusting them, as this is not the first time that HP have disappointed. For instance, their failure to update the HP 8600 Pro AirPrint drivers back when  iOS 11 was a thing, and yet still they still have not resolved the problem regarding the scaling of printed images.\n\nBut this review relates to HP SMART, (Smart is not a word I would use to describe this app though). Whilst scanning lots of images to my iPad Pro, I tried to make them into a PDF.  Unfortunately the software had other ideas and crashed.  When I reopened the app, predictably it no longer had any of the scans I had been working on.  Of course I was less than impressed, after losing 2 hours of work.\n\nThe app redesign leaves a lot to be desired.  Like Apple who seem to be having a war against common sense, HP seem to have decided in their Trump like wisdom that Users will know what to do, just because HP designers and engineers do.  Osmosis is not a learning tool, either make things obvious or don't change them.\n\nAdditionally, if you have quite a few images in a folder, the app just plan messes around with your files.\n\n1) It will allow you to rename the files, sure, but if you name the image something previously within that directory, it will take the thumbnail from the previous image and overlay it on the new one.  Even if the image is no longer present in the directory.\n\n2) Renaming images with names from old ones also increases the chance that HP Smart will decide to replace your current image with the old name one. This even seems to happen even if the old image has been deleted or is not longer in the directory.  The only work around seems to be to exit the app, kill it in multiswitcher and then reopen it.  Not an ideal solution, as it can lead to problems if you are dealing with over 150 scans in a folder.\n\n3) If you have lots of scans in a folder, in excess of 100, the app will not remember any of the edits you've made to the images.  For instance, if you rotate the image, exit and save your changes, then quit the app and reopen it, the image will have reverted to its old orientation.  This applies to all the cropping and editing tools in the app.\n\n4) The likelihood of Crashing the app, increases as you perform edits on images.  If you edit lots of images after you scan them, it is highly likely to crash loosing all your work.\n\n5) The app has been redesigned, but there is a distinct lack of any hints as to how to do things.  For instance editing an image is a game of hit and miss.  I eventually found that you have to tap the image, but only after poking around and stabbing at things.\n\n6) To top it all, if you turn off iCloud Sync, but choose to keep all the files you've scanned on your iPad, it has other ideas and deletes all files it has stored locally.  Don't even try and turn it back on as all files will be gone.  In other words, scan things and immediately extract them from the App, as HP CAN NOT be trusted to handle data.\n\nAgain not a stellar performance and not what I would have expected from HP.  The only thing this app is good for now is a gateway to scanning.  Forget the editing tools or anything else it supports, it is not currently worth the effort of wading through the bugs.\n\nI give the App 1 star as it is able to load and scan, but as for the rest . . .",

Last resort tends to be removing and re-adding. Worse from my Laptop, so usually I’m pinging between phone and app in the hope one of them will finally work. Wishing I’d kept the aging Epson which printed just worked, faultlessly. I’ve also been told my ink levels are low and I’ll be receiving supplies in the post for at least the last 3-4mths. Money well spent.. after all of this when I finally get my printout it’s illegible and I waste another 1/2hr cleaning heads or running through the alignment process. Just for that one label printout. A complete and utter failure and total waste of money. Unreliable, poorly made piece of plastic junk. Think I’ll invest in a fountain pen and some quality ink.",

To continue using the installed HP Instant Ink cartridge, the printer must be enrolled.\"\n\nThey market the subscription as a cheaper, more convenient way to get ink but the second you can't renew your subscription you printer essentially becomes an expensive paper weight! And God forbid you use non subscription ink, because a postal strike caused your subscription ink to be severely delayed, cuz the printer throws a fit over that too!\n\nI paid good money for this printer and now it's completely useless! \n\nI won't be buying HP printers or HP Ink in the future!  I'll be going with a brand that doesn't force subscriptions by rendering a product you OWN completely useless if you end up in a position where you can't give them MORE money than you've already given them! \n\nHP does not care about it's customers only what's in their wallets!",

It goes offline at random (while everything else in the house works just fine). There is no option to scale images up or down, so if I want a 5x7\" image, I have to use 5x7\" paper. If I want a 4x6\" image, I need to use 4x6\" paper. What the heck? I had to re-register the bloody printer when I installed new cartridges. And the menu bar options are so basic that NOWHERE is there helpful information. Yes, it'll print a basic document very well. Beyond that? I am beyond frustrated and ready to toss it.",

Maybe 20 pages of printing and a XL cartridge was empty. I finally found the setting to make sure it was set to the lowest quality, and it was.

I just downloaded a new software I’ve never seen before, that automatically prints instructions on how to perform the steps THAT I JUST PERFORMED. \n\nIf I have to get wifi instructions printed every-TIME I connect this HP, then I’m not sure if I want this brand anymore within my business. I need my equipment to do what I need it to do, when I need to do it, and we don’t need printers in our premises that suddenly change how they operate (at random intervals). I don’t feel like setting up this printer over and over (and over) in such a remedial, redundant and inefficient way. \n\nYour software is (now) abysmal. The fiscal and technical reasons for this direction in your company is escaping me. In my opinion this is a now a very substandard software; we are removing the rest of these printers from our premises as we speak.\n\nAnwar Cushnie.",

I’ve also printed 5 pages as it’s already low on ink so overall I could not recommend.",

I did the install via my IPhone and could not believe how easy it was. Easily connected to WIFI and I am so happy that I can print from my phone 😀 HP offered a  6 months trial of Insta Ink, but I decided not to subscribe due to the limited amount of printing I do. \nFrim the app is showed how to scan, which was the easiest scan I have ever done, just took a picture from my iPhone pressed auto & pressed . pdf I could not be more happy as I scan everything that comes in the post, warranties etc. it has an ADF which comes in very handy. U can’t speak highly enough of my small investment. This purchase made my year, with the cost of living causing so much grief to people, I almost did not think I could afford a new printer. Thank you HP, you have a very happy customer in me 🙃🙃",

I've been able to get the direct print from email function to work, as well as copying and scanning. I am working on printing wirelessly from my icloud files, which is where I was running into a few problems with my HP laptop and iPhoneX. Not sure what is happening there. I hope to get the problem solved tonight. It's been nice getting familiar with a new device. I'm just a bit sad that the wireless function isn't yet working for me yet. Will have to wait until tomorrow to get HP phone support. Glad it's a free call. See how I go.",

I tried several times to login but still it won't let me login.. somehow if i login then after chosing all the option for the printout at last when it comes to the print page it won't let me press the print option!! like what is the use of having the app which is designed for the whole purpose of printing out documents and it can't even do that!! very highly disappointed by printer and the service.",

I only needed it for one month and ended up paying every month. Be careful with fraud agents. They don’t change your plan and you end up paying for it.

The app is incredibly user-friendly, making it easy to set up and connect my printer in just a few minutes. I love the intuitive interface, which allows me to print, scan, and manage my documents seamlessly from my smartphone or tablet.\n\nOne of the standout features for me is the ability to print directly from my cloud storage accounts like Google Drive and Dropbox. This integration has saved me so much time and hassle. The scanning function is equally impressive, providing high-quality scans that I can easily save or share right from the app.\n\nThe HP Smart app also includes useful tools like the print preview and photo editing options, which have been great for getting my photos just right before printing. Additionally, the app’s Instant Ink subscription service ensures I never run out of ink, which is a huge convenience.\n\nOverall, the HP Smart app offers a reliable and efficient solution for all my printing needs. It’s clear that a lot of thought has gone into its design and functionality, making it a must-have for anyone with an HP printer. Highly recommended!",

Die App will einen in ein Abo locken, damit man dauerhaft Geld abdrückt für Tonerlieferungen. Suggeriert wird Komfort, geht aber nur um Geld. Ich kann noch selber einkaufen. Davon angesehen, dass man mit der App keine HP Geräte installieren kann oder vorhandene Geräte nicht gefunden werden, wird man genötigt, ein HP-Konto anzulegen. Und immer schön online sein. Das mutet nach Datenkrake und Überwachung an. Dann weiß der Hersteller, was man wann, wo und wie von welchen Devices in welchem Netzwerk druckt. Alles klar HP. Das war’s dann. Nie wieder.",

Das Drucken lässt sich gut steuern. Beim Scannen bin ich dann sauer geworden, was aber wohl eher auf die WiFi-Fähigkeit des Druckers (MFP 179 fwg) zurückzuführen ist, der immer wieder die Verbindung ins WLAN verlor, dann zwar tapfer weiterscannte, aber die in der Empfang Pause verarbeiteten Daten schlicht ignorierte bzw. verlor. Der Drucker war also nicht in der Lage, die Daten zu puffern, um diese dann bei der Wiederherstellung der Verbindung diese zu senden. Das ist bei mehrseitigen Scans mehr als ärgerlich. Gefaxt habe ich noch nicht.\nDass ein Drucker unbedingt über eine App gesteuert werden muss finde ich nicht hilfreich, ist aber nun mal heutzutage so.\nÜberzeugt bin ich also nicht, werde sehen, welche Erfahrungen ich noch sammeln werde - hoffentlich mehr Gutes.",

Vor jedem einzelnen Druckauftrag muss ich den Drucker manuell entfernen und wieder neu hinzufügen. Selbst dann dauert es ewig, bis irgendetwas funktioniert, wenn überhaupt. Zusätzlich werden die Seitenränder meiner Dateien nicht mehr korrekt gedruckt, was mir heute sogar ein wichtiges Ereignis ruiniert hat, weil ich ein Dokument nicht rechtzeitig ausdrucken konnte.\n\nIch habe unzählige Neustarts und Netzwerktests durchgeführt, aber nichts hilft. Die Erfahrung ist extrem frustrierend, und ich bin sehr enttäuscht von der aktuellen Software. Für mich steht fest: Ich werde kein HP-Produkt mehr kaufen.",

Die automatische Erkennung der Dokumente funktionierte. Bin sprachlos. Das hatte ich nicht erwartet.",

Man bekommt Hinweis, dass es irgendeine Fehler aufgetreten ist und man soll es später probieren. Ich weiß nicht warum, aber irgendwie Ihr habt euch schön verschlechtert. Ich überlege mir vielleicht wechsel ich irgendwann den Drucker. Gehe ich vielleicht zu einer anderen Firma. Wo es funktioniert.",

    "content": "Die HP Smart App für iOS ist grundsätzlich eine solide und benutzerfreundliche Anwendung, mit der sich HP-Drucker problemlos einrichten und bedienen lassen. Die Verbindung zwischen Mobilgerät und Drucker erfolgt in der Regel schnell und zuverlässig. Besonders positiv hervorzuheben ist die einfache Bedienoberfläche, die es auch technisch weniger versierten Nutzern ermöglicht, Druck-, Scan- oder Kopiervorgänge ohne größere Schwierigkeiten durchzuführen.\n\nTrotz dieser Vorteile weist die App jedoch einige erhebliche Mängel auf, die das Nutzungserlebnis deutlich beeinträchtigen. Insbesondere beim Scannen fehlt die Möglichkeit, benutzerdefinierte Einstellungen vorzunehmen. So ist es beispielsweise nicht möglich, Maßeinheiten oder exakte Zahlenwerte für die Seitengröße manuell einzugeben. Diese Einschränkung reduziert die Flexibilität erheblich – insbesondere für Nutzer, die präzise Formate oder spezielle Scanvorgaben benötigen.\n\nEin weiterer Kritikpunkt betrifft die Versionen der App für Windows und macOS. Hier kommt es regelmäßig zu Problemen mit hängenden Druckaufträgen. Diese bleiben häufig in der Warteschlange stecken, was die weitere Nutzung des Druckers blockiert. In vielen Fällen hilft nur ein vollständiges Ausschalten und erneutes Einschalten des Druckers, um den Fehler zu beheben – ein umständlicher und zeitraubender Vorgang, der in einer professionellen Umgebung kaum akzeptabel ist.\n\nZusammenfassend lässt sich sagen: Die HP Smart App erfüllt im Alltag grundlegende Aufgaben zuverlässig, weist jedoch bei erweiterten Funktionen und in der Stabilität der Desktop-Versionen gravierende Schwächen auf. Eine gezielte Weiterentwicklung insbesondere im Bereich der benutzerdefinierten Scanoptionen sowie der Druckauftragsverwaltung wäre dringend wünschenswert.",

Toda vez aparece que meu login ou minha senha estão inválidos, mesmo eu colocando tudo corretamente. Já tentei diversas vezes, reinstalei, mudei a senha e nada resolve.\n\nAlém disso, várias funções que antes eram práticas agora nem chegam a carregar. A experiência piorou demais, parece que o app regrediu em vez de melhorar. Isso já faz tempo e até agora não arrumaram, o que mostra descaso com os usuários.\n\nAntes da atualização o aplicativo era bom, rápido e confiável. Agora está praticamente inutilizável. Muito decepcionante ver um app que funcionava bem se tornar tão problemático depois de uma simples troca de nome e atualização.

Para cambiar tinta o cualquier cosa hay que recurrir a vídeos de YouTube porque otra vez el menú es confuso y no hay tutoría les fáciles de cosas de uso básico. Hoy en día se imprime documentos, cambia tinta y poco más. Yo solo necesito saber si falta papel, si falta tinta o si hay que actualizar el software. Si quiero imprimir desde el móvil simplemente enviando a la impresora no imprime ni me da error, ni muestra una lista de entrega pendientes o algo…Enfin que la aplicación es malísima e inútil.

    "content": "Desde el ordenador la conexión wifi va muy bien y no suele dar problemas pero desde la App es horroroso. Cada vez que intentas escanear un imprimir me dice que la impresora no está disponible. Abro y cierro la puerta de la impresora para que vuelva a la vida pero no es suficiente y tengo que desenchufarla y volverla a enchufar. Y si tengo que escanear muchas fotos es fácil que se me desconecte después de un rato. Y a veces eso supone perder todos los escanees y volver a empezar. No va bien la App.",

También intentaron ayudarme desde el servicio técnico, sin saber porque pasaba. Además se conectaba mal y para imprimir documentos en PDF tengo que descargármelo primero todo, por lo que no es buena impresora si manejas un gran número de documentos y trabajas desde la nube. Al final me cambiaron la impresora. Esta segunda impresora me llega sin cable. Ya solucionado, ya puedo conectarla al enchufe. Resulta que ahora los Word los imprime mal, es decir, me imprime una cara como si imprimiera dos hojas, por lo que sale hipermegapequeño el texto. Ahora tengo q estar pasando todo a PDF,documento a documento, tras haberlo descargado claro. Bueno, lo nuevo, NO ME DEJA A IMPRIMIR A DOBLE CARA. Con la actualización de Hp Smart, no existe la opción. Además si los textos son para subrayar, la tinta de corre. Elegir hp ha sido el mayor error. Fatal.",

    "content": "El modelo de suscripción te compromete a pagos recurrentes sin que estos cumplan su único cometido, que es el buen funcionamiento y disponibilidad de tinta para la impresora. En cambio, se aseguran de que si no es bajo sus \"condiciones\", la impresora quede totalmente inutilizada. Además, pretenden cobrar por hoja, no por la cantidad de tinta utilizada (la correlación se da a su favor).\n\nEn otras palabras, es un servicio de impresión bajo demanda en el que tienes que pagar por la impresora, el mantenimiento y, además, la espera. La rentabilidad que obtienen así es enorme, asegurándose pagos recurrentes (lo que les brinda un considerable cashflow) y creando barreras para la competencia, a costa del consumidor. \n\nNo es inteligente. Lo inteligente sería encubrir la cuota mensual como un servicio de mantenimiento en línea, dar la impresora \"gratis\" y, ofrecer además, la cantidad de tinta necesaria.",

Wat jammer dat een simpel product wordt uitgemolken tot een gecompliceerd onding, waardoor het apparaat veranderd in een schaduw van wat het had moeten zijn. Ik zie een printer-scanner, ik ervaar een onnodig tijd verspillend ict project. Een app om het product te gebruiken via je telefoon en wifi prima. Een modern apparaat dat niet als ‘failsafe’ bekabeling heeft is kwalijk. Samenvattend; app werkt beroerd, onnodig ingewikkeld en te veel ingesteld op de consument ‘overcommited’ maken aan het hp ecosysteem. De gekoppelde printer, in mijn geval de hp deskjet 2721e zal vast een prima apparaat zijn als ik het met een optionele kabel aan de computer kan koppelen en op het knopje PRINTEN of SCANNEN klik. Kan het apparaat niet. Vies. Bah. Oja tevens het verplichten van een app, en daarmee dus al mijn documenten door het bijbehorende ecosysteem te pushen waardoor je wel blind vertrouwen moet hebben in het bedrijf waar je documenten doorheen gaan, vind ik eng. Ik geloof op veiligheidsgebied niet in kwaadwilligheid van hp, maar des te minder bedrijven in en om mijn documenten, des te beter. \n\nHP sorry, you just missed the point on personal administrative safety and your unnecessary involvement in them.",

Ik raad deze manier van printen en service zeer zeker aan in mijn administratieve netwerk en bij mijn klanten!  Top product, en dat voor een zachte prijs. \n\nPS: HP doet ook aan het kosteloos recyclen van je oude inkt patronen. Dit alles is voor mij de reden van de 5 sterren die ik heb gegeven.",

Via de klantenservice kom ik niet verder want die zijn alleen binnen kantoor tijden bereikbaar en met mijn drukke baan heb ik de tijd niet om dan te bellen. Via de app of de bot kom ik niet verder want mijn vraag staat er niet tussen dus stoppen ze het gesprek. En mijn klacht wordt niet doorgestuurd naar HP zelf over dat ik geen inkt meer geleverd krijg. \n\nDaarnaast krijg ik vaak een foutmelding zonder dat er nou duidelijk is wat er fout is gegaan in de app zelf. De app blijft dan hangen op zo’n wordt geleden / we zoeken naar de fout scherm. Waardoor ik het niet kan oplossen en mijn printer helemaal niet meer kan gebruiken. \n\nHet lijkt allemaal zo makkelijk, tot er iets niet werkt dan kun je gewoon weken je printer niet gebruiken.

For example, making us take 30 mins to scan a 50-page document (double-sided) when it could have been done in 3 mins.  \n\nReally hope HP would fix this issue ASAP. Or else, please don’t call this app ‘HP Smart’ because to many users it is simply ‘HP Stupid’.",

I hardly print and I haven’t even used 90% of my starter ink (that comes with the printer) and I have to start paying for new ones. What a scam. I don’t recommend HP, and I don’t recommend this current model. The one style is much better. Don’t buy HP2700 deskjet series as well. Every time I switched on there is error code and I have to print out to know what’s the issue. Majority of my printed papers came from these forced to print error codes. What a scam and how HP has stooped to such Low levels.",
