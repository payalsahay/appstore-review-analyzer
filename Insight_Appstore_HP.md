---

**Report Type:** Product Management Customer Insights

## EXECUTIVE ANALYSIS

### The Bottom Line

**HP's printer app is a case study in how aggressive monetization destroys customer trust.** Users feel "trapped" in a subscription model, with printers that refuse to work without an Instant Ink subscription.

The core product issues mirror the competition:
1. **WiFi connectivity fails constantly** — printers go offline, require hours to reconnect
2. **Subscription model feels like extortion** — users can't use their own ink
3. **Setup is a nightmare** — 2-3+ hours for "technical adults"
4. **Updates remove features** — fax functionality disappeared, scanning degraded

**The HP brand is actively damaged.** Multiple reviews include phrases like "never buying HP again" and "throwing it in the trash."

### Key Business Risks

| Risk | Impact | Urgency |
|------|--------|---------|
| Subscription backlash | Brand damage, churn | CRITICAL |
| Connectivity failures | Core function unusable | CRITICAL |
| Update regressions | Feature loss, trust erosion | HIGH |
| Setup abandonment | Returns, support costs | HIGH |
| "Never HP again" sentiment | Long-term revenue loss | SEVERE |

### The Subscription Problem

HP's Instant Ink subscription model is generating **extreme negative sentiment**:
- Users feel "held hostage"
- Printers brick if subscription lapses
- Third-party ink blocked by firmware updates
- Perception of HP as "predatory" company

## DETAILED ISSUE ANALYSIS

### 🔴 ISSUE #1: Subscription/Instant Ink Model (25% of reviews)

**What Customers Say:**

| Sentiment | % | Sample Voice of Customer |
|-----------|---|--------------------------|
| Negative | 95% | "HP is making me pay for an ink plan I don't need just so I can use my printer" |
| Positive | 3% | "Instant Ink saves money" |
| Neutral | 2% | "The subscription is optional" |

**Root Causes:**
- Printers won't function without subscription
- Third-party ink blocked by firmware
- Subscription cancellation disables printer
- Ink levels reported incorrectly to force purchases
- Aggressive upselling in app

**Customer Quotes:**
> "HP is a predatory company. Their ink costs more than blood. Look it up."

> "I think the forced subscription is such a big downgrade. I believe HP should allow us to buy our own cartridges."

> "They control everything about this printer. I'm not even able to purchase less expensive ink cause the printer won't work if I do."

> "SUBSCRIPTION BASED INKS?! BOOOOO YOU STINK"

> "HP's ink service feels like a scam. When you buy a printer, you should be able to use it without being roped into a monthly payment."

**PM Recommendation:**
- Allow printers to function with any HP-branded ink
- Make subscription truly optional (not required)

## APPENDIX: VOICE OF CUSTOMER SAMPLES

### Most Impactful Negative Reviews

> "I am not medicated enough to deal with these confusing printers. I sincerely wish I was kidding when I say it took two PhDs 30 minutes to try set up this junk and it still isn't working. To the executives making these decisions: I hope your parents are never proud of you again."

> "HP is probably the worst company ever created. Your apps suck. Your printers suck. How is it, I have a printer on the HP app, and when I click to manage more settings for it, it takes me to a page that says I don't have any printers!???"

> "I just want to print some pages. I don't know why I have to create an account, go through a convoluted maze of steps and then get a subscription to be able to print a few pages. Corporate greed at its finest."

> "NEVER BUY THIS. Absolutely garbage. Made so poorly and it's a complete money grabbing scam."

### Most Impactful Positive Reviews

> "I've had this printer going on 6 years now and this thing is a beast. Never had any issues with it. Connects to my phone seamlessly. The HP app literally shows me the ink levels and does everything I could ever want."

> "The hp app as well as their devices have made all of my office needs accessible to my home. I have every capability that I would have to pay for inside of any print shop."

> "Zero issues installing from iPhone and then PC! Both print and scan flawlessly."
