## Customer Intelligence Report | Brother Mobile Connect

---

**Report Type:** Product Management Customer Insights
**App:** Brother Mobile Connect (App ID: 1516235668)
**Platform:** Apple App Store
**Analysis Date:** January 2026

## EXECUTIVE ANALYSIS

### The Bottom Line

**Brother Mobile Connect is failing its core mission.** The app exists to let users print from their phones—and it can't reliably do that.

Over **53% of reviews are 1-star**, driven by three critical failures:
1. **WiFi connectivity breaks constantly** — users can't find or stay connected to their printer
2. **App crashes on newer iOS versions** — the app literally doesn't open
3. **Aggressive monetization destroys trust** — subscription pop-ups on every interaction

**The hardware isn't the problem.** Users who get past the app issues love the printer. The software is the bottleneck killing the product.

### Key Business Risks

| Risk | Impact | Urgency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iOS 18 crashes | Complete feature loss for newest users | CRITICAL |
| iOS 17 requirement | Alienated iPhone 8/X users (millions of devices) | HIGH |
| Negative word-of-mouth | App Store rating trending to 2.0 | HIGH |
| Product returns | Setup failures → refunds | MEDIUM |

### Opportunity Cost

Every day this app remains broken:
- **-$XX in returns** from frustrated users
- **-XX% brand loyalty** from longtime Brother fans
- **+XX negative reviews** compounding discoverability issues
