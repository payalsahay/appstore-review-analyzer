While I don’t like the fact that I have a set number of pages I can print out I get charged extra, I still love it! The way I see it is I already paid for the printer and I’m paying for the ink so I should be able to print however many pages I want a month. But there’s more pros than cons with this printer, like being able to scan pages with your computer and then send faxes through the app",

I didn’t realize just how easily this connects to your HP printer and we’ve had our printer for years so I’m impressed with the backwards compatibility. An even nicer surprise was that I was able to fax a document directly from this app right after scanning it. I just happened to stumble upon that feature after just the day before looking for apps that would allow for free faxing. Very impressed and I like how the scanning feature shows a live updated document while the scan is occurring.",

Having to login to check ink levels or make printer adjustments is inconvenient.  Pop up adds promoting the easy ink program is annoying too. No tutorial after major app updates.  My access to select my photos is buried below other folders so it does not show up on. my screen.  So you have to scroll down to see it.  At first I didn’t know there was other folders below what was on the screen so I could find my photos folder so I didn’t use the iPad app.  It was only after another app update that I noticed upon loading that it showed all the folders then resized to show only a few folders on my screen. so I tried scrolling down and found my photos folder. I’ve had this printer for 5 years and when it breaks down I will be looking at other brands.",

    "content": "If there was a case study on how bad a product can be, this should be one of the fine examples. Here are my findings for future scholars. \n1. Asks for subscriptions one too many times - this is a printer and a scanner, which blocks you from using anything other than their sub-par ink to print anything and you are asked to pay them money every month\n2. Why do i need an account to scan my document? There is literally no logical reason to need an account for a scan job. \n3. Scan at 300DPI when my machine supports 1200DPI. Imagine you spent $100 on a high quality camera that can shoot at 48 megapixel, but the app, the only way to take the photo, delivers the product in 12 megapixel. Gameboy camera kit had a better resolution than this joke. \n4. Constantly disconnects after a scan job. Whoever designed the firmware clearly has no business in embedded software engineering if they can’t keep a connection alive. \n5. Apple human interface guideline is ignored in every chance. You guys clearly thought you had better UX than Apple guideline, which isn’t perfect, but light years better than this UX, designed when Germans were still flying overhead",

If I don’t hear back from someone at HP explaining why this new process is necessary, let alone better, I will never ever buy an HP product EVER again and will do what I can to ensure others abide by the same.

So very excited about the things that I can actually do with it. Was definitely worth the money got it on sale for Christmas it’s going to save me money but also the money I would spend on getting them developed now I can put that money toward getting the paper that I need to print my pictures and depending on size the paper it’s self can be pricey but the money that I spend in a month from getting them developed I can buy the photo paper almost 4 time for it to add up what I spend a month on getting them developed it’s my kids I take pics of so of course I’m get them developed because to me that’s memories that I have of my children birthday first day of school whatever got to do it while there young that way I always have the memories of my kids been a certain age or whatever .",

The problem with that is there’s no lock because some of the images are way bigger that I need to print in multiple sheets to make my stencils so there needs to be a lock on that because once you move it, it’ll adjust the size now with the new update when you select the printer you have to select it multiple times like way over four times Before it will connect to the printer. And it happens not only to be, but to multiple people I work with then when you do go to resize and you get it to the size you want and hit print it’ll reset then you have to go resize it again and hit print again twice and it happens every single time so fix those issues before you’re messing with making the screen black or whatever you want make the right changes.",

    "content": "this new update made my small business grind to a screeching halt today, for hours!  i had just got started printing out a batch of invoices when suddenly my printer seemed to virtually ‘disappear’ and i could not figure out how to remedy the process.  the print function was disabled and said that there was not a printer available while the app said the printer was awake and all is well.  i finally figured out i had to click on the export icon then select print by app.  by the time it actually starts printing i have made a total of 5 EXTRA clicks.  and then another 4 clicks after the print job is completed before i can start the next.  this has doubled the amount of time i used to take just to print invoices.  one other feature on the newly updated app that i do not see available is the option to increase or decrease the image size.  for example i need to be able to decrease the size from 100% to 90% so that a 2 page print job will fit on 1 page.   and i need to decrease to 75% for my usps postage labels to fit nicely on my packages.  i REALLY NEED this feature and if i can figure out how to connect to the printer w my ipad without this app, i will.  so far all it is doing is pissing me off.",
