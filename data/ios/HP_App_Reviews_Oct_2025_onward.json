The way I see it is I already paid for the printer and I’m paying for the ink so I should be able to print however many pages I want a month. But there’s more pros than cons with this printer, like being able to scan pages with your computer and then send faxes through the app",

I didn’t realize just how easily this connects to your HP printer and we’ve had our printer for years so I’m impressed with the backwards compatibility. An even nicer surprise was that I was able to fax a document directly from this app right after scanning it. I just happened to stumble upon that feature after just the day before looking for apps that would allow for free faxing. Very impressed and I like how the scanning feature shows a live updated document while the scan is occurring.",

Having to login to check ink levels or make printer adjustments is inconvenient.  Pop up adds promoting the easy ink program is annoying too. No tutorial after major app updates.  My access to select my photos is buried below other folders so it does not show up on. my screen.  So you have to scroll down to see it.  At first I didn’t know there was other folders below what was on the screen so I could find my photos folder so I didn’t use the iPad app.  It was only after another app update that I noticed upon loading that it showed all the folders then resized to show only a few folders on my screen. so I tried scrolling down and found my photos folder. I’ve had this printer for 5 years and when it breaks down I will be looking at other brands.",

    "content": "If there was a case study on how bad a product can be, this should be one of the fine examples. Here are my findings for future scholars. \n1. Asks for subscriptions one too many times - this is a printer and a scanner, which blocks you from using anything other than their sub-par ink to print anything and you are asked to pay them money every month\n2. Why do i need an account to scan my document? There is literally no logical reason to need an account for a scan job. \n3. Scan at 300DPI when my machine supports 1200DPI. Imagine you spent $100 on a high quality camera that can shoot at 48 megapixel, but the app, the only way to take the photo, delivers the product in 12 megapixel. Gameboy camera kit had a better resolution than this joke. \n4. Constantly disconnects after a scan job. Whoever designed the firmware clearly has no business in embedded software engineering if they can’t keep a connection alive. \n5. Apple human interface guideline is ignored in every chance. You guys clearly thought you had better UX than Apple guideline, which isn’t perfect, but light years better than this UX, designed when Germans were still flying overhead",

If I don’t hear back from someone at HP explaining why this new process is necessary, let alone better, I will never ever buy an HP product EVER again and will do what I can to ensure others abide by the same.

So very excited about the things that I can actually do with it. Was definitely worth the money got it on sale for Christmas it’s going to save me money but also the money I would spend on getting them developed now I can put that money toward getting the paper that I need to print my pictures and depending on size the paper it’s self can be pricey but the money that I spend in a month from getting them developed I can buy the photo paper almost 4 time for it to add up what I spend a month on getting them developed it’s my kids I take pics of so of course I’m get them developed because to me that’s memories that I have of my children birthday first day of school whatever got to do it while there young that way I always have the memories of my kids been a certain age or whatever .",

The problem with that is there’s no lock because some of the images are way bigger that I need to print in multiple sheets to make my stencils so there needs to be a lock on that because once you move it, it’ll adjust the size now with the new update when you select the printer you have to select it multiple times like way over four times Before it will connect to the printer. And it happens not only to be, but to multiple people I work with then when you do go to resize and you get it to the size you want and hit print it’ll reset then you have to go resize it again and hit print again twice and it happens every single time so fix those issues before you’re messing with making the screen black or whatever you want make the right changes.",

    "content": "this new update made my small business grind to a screeching halt today, for hours!  i had just got started printing out a batch of invoices when suddenly my printer seemed to virtually ‘disappear’ and i could not figure out how to remedy the process.  the print function was disabled and said that there was not a printer available while the app said the printer was awake and all is well.  i finally figured out i had to click on the export icon then select print by app.  by the time it actually starts printing i have made a total of 5 EXTRA clicks.  and then another 4 clicks after the print job is completed before i can start the next.  this has doubled the amount of time i used to take just to print invoices.  one other feature on the newly updated app that i do not see available is the option to increase or decrease the image size.  for example i need to be able to decrease the size from 100% to 90% so that a 2 page print job will fit on 1 page.   and i need to decrease to 75% for my usps postage labels to fit nicely on my packages.  i REALLY NEED this feature and if i can figure out how to connect to the printer w my ipad without this app, i will.  so far all it is doing is pissing me off.",

The last one stopped working and trying to problem solve it was a night mate in the end I just gave up and bought a new one. It came with free ink. Hp continued to charge me for instant ink despite having not been able to print anything and I figured it made sense to use the free ink I got with it. It also came with a 3 month free instant ink however upon setting up the printer it asks me to setup hp + and today’s that after I do I won’t be able to use instant ink. The whole thing is a confusing mess and not user friendly at all. The app is so glitchy so expect hours to be wasted staring at a loading symbol and getting instantly kicked out and having to constantly re log in to it. There was no answer on the customer support line. I waited and eventually just got cut off. I would not recommendHP!",

Installing the printer on the PC was hard work and the app both on mobile and PC has a mind of its own. Sometimes it will render a word document, then it won’t. It’s just been hard work. I breath a sign of relief every time it delivers what is asked. I think perhaps the tech is just a bit too clever for its own good. I still can’t get it to talk to the PC vía wifi so have plugged in a good old Ethernet cable. Disappointing and time wasting.",

I’ve unplugged the printer as it is slightly less annoying if I pretend it doesn’t exist.  The set up process is flawed: the set up instructions in the app quick setup are woefully incorrect, and the app tries to register the printer with HP even when it is not connected to the internet yet.

You get billed for every page you print, even if you did not order any paper, and have not had an ink order in YEARS. You pay just for the act of printing. I couldn’t believe it when I was billed £20.00 for printing a few pages of my OWN paper. The customer “service” is effin useless, too.  Just takes you to a GPT bot and doesn’t offer the option to speak with a real person. I’m afraid this is the last straw with HP, Cancelled my membership and shan’t be returning. \n\nTake my advice and get the standard ink cartridges. They don’t make it obvious that this is even an option. Once you subscribe to the ink service, you have to remain on the service in order to even use the printer as the ink cartridges are connected to your account. What a joke. HP, count your m’effin days.",

    "content": "Why do we have to use an app to be able to use basic functions of our HP printers? I like to print off diagnostic reports every few days to help stop the ink cartridges blocking up and causing streaks (of course, despite doing this, that still get streaks!).\n\nI can only print this report via this app. I can’t just do it from the printer itself, because that would be too straightforward, and it doesn’t give HP the opportunity to sell you their ink replacement programme. Anyway, it takes ages for this app to connect to my printer properly, and trying to print off a simple report takes ages too. All this modern nonsense just makes everything more complicated and a worse user experience.",

Einfach nichts ist perfekt und für meinen Geschmack könnte die App noch ein paar mehr Detailliertere Einstellungen anbieten ähnlich der Windows Applikation.  Zudem könnte man die Einstellungen ggf. Übersichtlicher/Zentraler gestalten. Beispiel beim Scannen befinden sich die Einstellungen auf unterschiedlichen Buttons statt das Menü in Menü zu gestalten. Eine Möglichkeit vermisse ich noch oder habe dies noch nicht gefunden… Wenn man Scannt mit der App und mehrere nicht zusammenhängende Seiten Scannt fehlt mir die Möglichkeit vor dem speichern manuell die Dateien zu trennen so das man mit einem Scann mehrere Dateien speichern kann. Aber dennoch alles was ich bisher gebraucht habe mit Ausnahme des einen was oben beschrieben wurde ist die App Top !",

Die eigenen Geräte werden zur Installation nicht erkannt, die Geräte selbst scheinen minderwertige Module verbaut zu haben. Die App will einen in ein Abo locken, damit man dauerhaft Geld abdrückt für Tonerlieferungen. Suggeriert wird Komfort, geht aber nur um Geld. Ich kann noch selber einkaufen. Davon angesehen, dass man mit der App keine HP Geräte installieren kann oder vorhandene Geräte nicht gefunden werden, wird man genötigt, ein HP-Konto anzulegen. Und immer schön online sein. Das mutet nach Datenkrake und Überwachung an. Dann weiß der Hersteller, was man wann, wo und wie von welchen Devices in welchem Netzwerk druckt. Alles klar HP. Das war’s dann. Nie wieder.",

Der Drucker war also nicht in der Lage, die Daten zu puffern, um diese dann bei der Wiederherstellung der Verbindung diese zu senden. Das ist bei mehrseitigen Scans mehr als ärgerlich. Gefaxt habe ich noch nicht.\nDass ein Drucker unbedingt über eine App gesteuert werden muss finde ich nicht hilfreich, ist aber nun mal heutzutage so.\nÜberzeugt bin ich also nicht, werde sehen, welche Erfahrungen ich noch sammeln werde - hoffentlich mehr Gutes.",

    "content": "Die App ist noch schlechter geworden. Es ist nicht akzeptabel, dass die Scan-Funktion nur noch mit Anmeldung bei HP funktioniert. Über Jahre ging es ohne Probleme , ohne einen HP Account eingerichtet zu haben und ohne sich vor dem Scannen bei HP anmelden zu müssen. Technisch gibt es dafür auch keinen Grund. Ferner ist bei meinem OfficeJet 8600 Pro (also kein billiges Heim-Modell) die Kommunikation mit dem Internet aus guten Gründen unterbunden.\nAnstelle die wichtigsten Informationen direkt zu sehen, muss man jetzt erst scrollen da einem zunächst Werbung für die Bestellung von HP Tintenpatronen angezeigt wird. So nicht HP. Der nächste Drucker wird nicht mehr von HP sein.",

Ich versteh es nicht, es ist einfach weder benutzerfreundlich noch intuitiv. Warum kann die Oberfläche nicht so sein wie vorher, mit einer klaren Auswahl Möglichkeit ob ich jetzt mit dem Drucker scannen möchte oder ob ich den Kamera Scan ohne den Drucker nutzen möchte bzw. Die anderen Auswahlmöglichkeiten die es gab. Bitte unbedingt wieder benutzerfreundlich und übersichtlich machen!!!!",

Toda vez aparece que meu login ou minha senha estão inválidos, mesmo eu colocando tudo corretamente. Já tentei diversas vezes, reinstalei, mudei a senha e nada resolve.\n\nAlém disso, várias funções que antes eram práticas agora nem chegam a carregar. A experiência piorou demais, parece que o app regrediu em vez de melhorar. Isso já faz tempo e até agora não arrumaram, o que mostra descaso com os usuários.\n\nAntes da atualização o aplicativo era bom, rápido e confiável. Agora está praticamente inutilizável. Muito decepcionante ver um app que funcionava bem se tornar tão problemático depois de uma simples troca de nome e atualização.

Eu só queria IMPRIMIR UM PAPEL, mas demora um século para ele achar a impressora, e para eu mover ela para outra rede tive que ficar procurando documentação ou videos pra descobrir como resetar a rede da impressora, nem um pouco intuitivo.
