13633982245,Brad11732953,5,Best hands down,I’ve had this printer going on 6 years now and this thing is a beast. Never had any issues with it. Connects to my phone seamlessly. The HP app literally shows me the ink levels and does everything I could ever want. The ink cartridges are very common and easy to find at the store. They even have a package to send back your old used cartridges. The best part is the printer was very inexpensive brand new. I have the HP OfficeJet 5255.

Couple that with fact that I have ink in my printer and I can run out of prints through this program, which I know is optional but supposedly more convenient, it’s kind of ridiculous.

13595241797,TrashCat13,3,Works but Needs work,I buy my own HP ink and the printer does not let you use all the ink before it starts printing faded pages. According to the graphic in the app a quarter of the ink is wasted.  Also sometimes after manually adjusting the image and test printing it defaults back to original image not giving me a chance to tweak my adjustment or reprint it.  Having to login to check ink levels or make printer adjustments is inconvenient.  Pop up adds promoting the easy ink program is annoying too. No tutorial after major app updates.  My access to select my photos is buried below other folders so it does not show up on. my screen.  So you have to scroll down to see it.  At first I didn’t know there was other folders below what was on the screen so I could find my photos folder so I didn’t use the iPad app.  It was only after another app update that I noticed upon loading that it showed all the folders then resized to show only a few folders on my screen. so I tried scrolling down and found my photos folder. I’ve had this printer for 5 years and when it breaks down I will be looking at other brands.,20.2.0,2026-01-04T13:53:21-07:00,us,iOS App Store,0

13581387132,Cropping Sucks,1,Not happy with last upgrade,This was a great app/program before last update. Now the “Crop” feature has changed and is not easy to manipulate.  I have resorted to taking a photo and crop it the photo before re-scanning and then making fine adjustments.  It’s so frustrating when developers just move forward with a lesser product in the name of “new update” and don’t give the user the ability to keep the original version. I may change out my printer to a different manufacturer due to this issue. I do a lot of scanning and editing and this last update has made cropping unusable for me.  Just disappointing.

13573731007,overpaidEngineer,1,All you can do wrong in a product in one,"If there was a case study on how bad a product can be, this should be one of the fine examples. Here are my findings for future scholars. 
1. Asks for subscriptions one too many times - this is a printer and a scanner, which blocks you from using anything other than their sub-par ink to print anything and you are asked to pay them money every month
2. Why do i need an account to scan my document? There is literally no logical reason to need an account for a scan job. 
3. Scan at 300DPI when my machine supports 1200DPI. Imagine you spent $100 on a high quality camera that can shoot at 48 megapixel, but the app, the only way to take the photo, delivers the product in 12 megapixel. Gameboy camera kit had a better resolution than this joke. 
4. Constantly disconnects after a scan job. Whoever designed the firmware clearly has no business in embedded software engineering if they can’t keep a connection alive. 
5. Apple human interface guideline is ignored in every chance. You guys clearly thought you had better UX than Apple guideline, which isn’t perfect, but light years better than this UX, designed when Germans were still flying overhead",20.2.0,2025-12-30T09:57:03-07:00,us,iOS App Store,0

Now, with the new printer I have to use two devices, an app, set up an account, then follow several more steps to get the document from the app on my phone to my email account. If I don’t hear back from someone at HP explaining why this new process is necessary, let alone better, I will never ever buy an HP product EVER again and will do what I can to ensure others abide by the same.

The last one stopped working and trying to problem solve it was a night mate in the end I just gave up and bought a new one. It came with free ink. Hp continued to charge me for instant ink despite having not been able to print anything and I figured it made sense to use the free ink I got with it. It also came with a 3 month free instant ink however upon setting up the printer it asks me to setup hp + and today’s that after I do I won’t be able to use instant ink. The whole thing is a confusing mess and not user friendly at all. The app is so glitchy so expect hours to be wasted staring at a loading symbol and getting instantly kicked out and having to constantly re log in to it. There was no answer on the customer support line. I waited and eventually just got cut off. I would not recommendHP!,20.2.0,2026-01-04T09:04:18-07:00,gb,iOS App Store,0

13647085879,ReCyCleR0815,4,Wirklich Gute App mit kleinem Verbessungspotenzial,Wirklich Gute App. Warum 4/5 Sterne. Einfach nichts ist perfekt und für meinen Geschmack könnte die App noch ein paar mehr Detailliertere Einstellungen anbieten ähnlich der Windows Applikation.  Zudem könnte man die Einstellungen ggf. Übersichtlicher/Zentraler gestalten. Beispiel beim Scannen befinden sich die Einstellungen auf unterschiedlichen Buttons statt das Menü in Menü zu gestalten. Eine Möglichkeit vermisse ich noch oder habe dies noch nicht gefunden… Wenn man Scannt mit der App und mehrere nicht zusammenhängende Seiten Scannt fehlt mir die Möglichkeit vor dem speichern manuell die Dateien zu trennen so das man mit einem Scann mehrere Dateien speichern kann.
