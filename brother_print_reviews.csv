Can’t print BW only?,You have totally destroyed my printer not allowing me to print just BW. Holding me hostage to buy a yellow cartridge. I cannot believe you guys just killed a great experience one had with his printer for over a year. What a pathetic update. You guys suck. Truly.,1,IvannaGolfer,2026-01-11T16:59:40-07:00,1.22.1,us

It doesn’t work,It never wants to print. It says that it’s connected to the printer but it fails every time. I have tried to troubleshoot it several times with no luck.,2,GingerBeerd LLC,2026-01-10T06:53:19-07:00,1.22.1,us

Does Not Work,"App wouldn’t work to set up a printer. Tried multiple times + restarted phone, app, and the printer. Just keep getting time outs. Set up printer manually. Now the app can’t even find the printer. Web UI for the printer works fine tho. And AirPrint works too so no need for this broken app.",1,philipamour,2026-01-08T08:09:50-07:00,1.22.1,us
Few customizable print settings on machine or in app,"When we shopped for this machine, I told the salesman at Office Depot that I definitely wanted to be able to print the occasional photo at home. And I was concerned that this machine would not print adequate photos. He told me that if I printed on photo paper I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between an inkjet and a laser printer. I printed a photo today on glossy photo paper and it does not look great. My main concern is that nowhere on the machine nor in the app, do you have an option to set the paper type for photo paper of any kind. I thought that might improve the quality of the printed photo but I guess I’ll never know.",1,Tmkos,2026-01-08T06:25:15-07:00,1.22.1,us

"Error when I hit click scan, no clear solution on website","Overall, this scanner has been great and initial set-up was easy. Lately, I keep getting a connection error when I click scan that says “Cannot Connect
Make sure your machine is connected to the same network that the mobile device is connected to.” However, both devices are connected to the WiFi. The app is fully updated.

Ended support for older phones,"Everything worked fine until a forced update that ends support for older devices. There’s no good reason to make working devices suddenly obsolete and prevent installed printing and scanning software from operating as it had before. Aside from that, I love my Brother printer, which is weird to say because every other printer I’ve owned or used has brought angst. This printer works beautifully, conveniently (besides needlessly deprecating my old phone), and reliably. The printer has been an actual joy to use, without all the four-letter words that accompanied every 10th print job with my old Canon printer. The software on PC and mobile works pretty well, but I wish I could still print and scan with my phone and iPad—it’s ridiculous that I now can’t. 
* I’d like to add that it’s weird that the app on my Windows PC is iPrint&Scan, and there’s an app of the same name for iOS that somehow doesn’t support my printer. The differentiation between this and that app is unclear and confusing, plus maddening that I can no longer use either.",2,Dalianguy,2025-12-20T18:05:25-07:00,1.20.1,us

i just want to print,this is the worst app and printer if you’re the type of person who doesn’t want to sit there and wait for the app to load for 30 minutes just to shut down the second you switch pages trying to make an account. i know toddlers that can program better,1,coal h,2025-12-16T11:41:34-07:00,1.22.0,us

Hate everything now,App used to work great then they wanted me to update the printer firmware. I did that. Then the app printing icons went away and it constantly says the printer is offline. I started to have issues printing from my laptop as well at the same time-obviously not app specific. I wouldn’t suggest this setup to my worst enemy at this point.,1,Angietsalagi,2025-12-10T23:35:11-07:00,1.22.0,us
so bad,listen. can you please test your own app? i tried to do a firmware update but the keyboard on the iphone is in the way. did u even test the ability to do the firmware update on ios? and why there is a password needed for a firmware update is just bizarre.,1,Joe a527,2025-12-08T10:09:23-07:00,1.21.5,us

Not Intuitive Setup,"Had to go through the full setup process on phone and then again on tablet since there is no simple login. Also not straightforward to setup. Printer has to be manually added despite already being connected to the same network in advance.

Great Printer And Interface,"I recently purchased a Brother MFC-J1010DW printer for $99. I am so glad I did! It was easy to set up! The black and white and color copies are decent and wireless printing is great! I am about to run out of the black introductory ink cartridge, but am fine with that, since replacement cartridges are available at a decent price.",5,jandrgold,2025-03-30T07:21:14-07:00,1.20.4,us
"The pitch says I can do it, but the app won’t let me","“Brother mobile connect” has one use for me, to connect to my Brother printer when I’m not in the house.

Specifically, I want to print stuff on my mom‘s printer for her without flying to Detroit each time. 

I can certainly set this up by using a dynamic DNS registration and a VPN to a remote server, but I want to do what both the printer and app says that it can do ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

I almost got it to work once, but it wanted me to type a passcode that was displayed on the printer, and I couldn’t get my mom to try downstairs, put on her glasses, and read off the code at the time. But now I’m in the same house, and I can’t get it to do that anymore.

So I think the functionality is there, and the blame rest entirely on a terrible horrible interface. 

I would give this app less than one star if I could.",1,JTW90210,2025-03-29T16:16:05-07:00,1.20.4,us

"Ok, but could be improved","I love the Brother laser printer, L2480DW.  I tried the manual wifi password and it showed connected but the mobile app would not see it.  I next tried the Wps technique using this mobile app.  It also connected, but the app again failed to see laser connect.  After many Internet searches I discovered that you MUST power off the laser for at least 15 seconds and turn on. (There is no reason that this information is not shown during the process.) The mobile app now saw the laser and connected. 
I got notices that there was a firmware update available on the LCD.   I very carefully followed instructions on the laser LCD and waited as instructed for it to complete.  
The mobile app now saw the laser. I registered the printer using an iPad.  Easy! 
I tried to add this device on an iPhone on same WiFi.  The app would not see it and appeared to want me to enter the WiFi data again as if the printer was never connected.  Several days later I opened the app on the iPhone and managed to see the printer and connect.  What I did I can’t duplicate as it was not clear.

On the top of the LCD display I keep seeing enter a new password.  I ignored this for now. 

I loaded the windows 10 driver from the OEM Brother web site.  Too much bloat wear, but the windows 10 system prints fine.  

Apple AirPrint works perfectly.  So does the printing from this app. 
I can’t comment on the other app features!

Has potential but….,"We have had this for 3 days now. The first day everything was great. We could print from different rooms no issues. After day 1…things went down hill fast. Our devices could pick up that the printer was there but it wouldn’t print. After many tries it finally would connect. Day 3, we had to reinstall the printer to our devices to get them to work. Even then, a few hours later it was back to not sending anything to the printer. I don’t have a computer that I can connect the printer to, just an iPad so it’s frustrating that I can’t always print what I need for school/teaching and other needs.

I reached out to customer service multiple times— both via phone and chat. Initially, I received a call back, but we lost connection right after I explained the issue. I request another call back, but it never happened. The agent I communicated with through IM seemed to know just as little about the printer, which was incredibly frustrating.

Does not work with iPhone 16 Pro Max,The printer MFC – J1010DW does not show on the iPhone 16 Pro Max. I have installed and reinstalled the app. I have unplugged. The printer waited five minutes and plugged it back in. The printer shows up on an iPhone 15 Pro Max and a new iPad Air. Even when I put in the model number and the IP address it’s still cannot be found on the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Obviously there’s a problem with the app. I called Apple. They don’t have a solution.

New to Brother printers,"It took me 35 min to find a way to print from my iPhone without having to pay.

"Great App, but a MAJOR annoyance","Everything works great, love the printer, love the speed of the app and the ease of use, BUT

Every time I boot the app it throws a message on the screen asking me to sign up for a toner subscription.  I have marked that I’m not interested several times. The window won’t close until it is fully loaded as well, which means it drains about 5 seconds of my life every time I want use the app. 

Something like that is extremely unnecessary. There’s no way I’d ever sign up for a subscription for toner, that’s an insane thing to do for a printer that I use maybe once a week max.",2,TheStrickers,2024-08-23T13:16:18-07:00,1.18.3,us

Doesn’t support iOS ShareSheet,"The built-in iOS “Print” action on the default iPhone ShareSheet doesn’t print certain PDF data correctly to Brother printers, but they print perfectly if printed from the MobileConnect app. No problem, right? Just add MobileConnect to the iOS ShareSheet… As of 6/2024, this app *can’t* be added to the iOS ShareSheet because support for the ShareSheet isn’t included in the code. This means that instead of being able to print directly from other apps on the iPhone via MobileConnect, you have to open MobileConnect *separately,* navigate back to whatever you wanted to print, and then print from there. The app seems to be quite good for what it does, but it BADLY needs to support iOS ShareSheet.

6/20/24 Update: the canned response from Brother isn’t helpful in the slightest.  I contacted Brother Support before writing my review; they fumbled around and said there was nothing they could do.",3,Michael in KS,2024-06-20T08:00:58-07:00,1.18.1,us

Brothers mobile app Failure,"I love Brothers printers, they are reliable, better than most for ink consumption and fairly fast. The downside is the software on the mobile side. Computer side you can adjust or tweak setting much better.

So have you ever wanted to pick 2 or 4 photos that you want wallet sized and have them print on one page? Let’s say you want to print a photo with 5 x 7 size? NOT going to happen with the Brothers Apps. For Gods sake it’s 2024 and they just can’t offer anything other than A4, A5, Full or legal size paper options? Why is that? So I went to the Brothers forum to ask how to print 5 x 7 photos and there were only 10 posts for 2024! I had tech support on the phone and she didn’t have a work around or solution.

I discovered the problem after two days of frustration. My internet connection was running at 5 ghz and the printer needs 2.5 ghz. Changed my internet settings and the printer works perfectly. Fast, crisp printing for very little money.",4,1wiest,2024-03-11T04:49:45-07:00,1.16.1,us

Worst wireless printer I have owned so far,It never prints when I ask it too. I have troubleshooted a ton. When it does decide it likes what I want it to print it only prints it on half the page. It’s crazy. So far not my fav for sure.,1,jhaven07,2024-02-21T14:50:26-07:00,1.16.1,us

Terrible program/printer,"Finally got the app to work - its set to make your printer disappear immediately it you don’t hassle to click on it before it disappears. Now it wants me to update the printer, but I have to put in a password (which one?) and it is extremely tedious, especially for a disabled person. But, I soldiered on and put in my Brother password (doesn’t it make sense that is what it’s wanting?) but, no. So, I put in my Wi-Fi password. Nope! Won’t accept that one either. Did this twice. Not only that, but you can’t back out and have to unplug it to get it off trying to update. So, I will only be able to use this printer (and app) until there are so many updates it won’t work anymore and then I guess I’ll just have to trash it. Bad, horrible, terrible engineering. Will go back to Epson after this no longer works because I can’t update the firmware.",1,Granny Doc,2024-02-17T20:59:59-07:00,1.16.1,us
Amazing Product!!!,"Hi, I received my printer and went through the setup process then I ran a few test prints and I was done…. Oh! The most important point to all this is that I struggled for a period of time with other brands, all of which weren’t iOS friendly. I highly recommend this product to anyone who use iOS based devices. HAPPY! HAPPY! HAPPY!!!",5,arlocust03,2024-02-16T04:39:46-07:00,1.16.1,us
Not efficient,Before the app I could easily select the option from my IPhone to send docs to the printer. Now I have to jump thru numerous hoops from various apps/internet to get documents to print,1,pjgyenge,2024-02-13T03:18:28-07:00,1.16.0,us
Worst Printer Ever,"From Day 1 I’ve had nothing but trouble with this printer.  Hours online, only to have the same problems over & over again.  Constantly dropping offline; trying to type my password in repeatedly on their ridiculously tiny screen.  There’s no rhyme or reason to why it suddenly will start connecting again—do I input the same info 10x? 20x? Who knows what the magic # is.  The simplest print jobs (especially when I need them NOW) take hours—sometimes days until it’s working again.

Don’t waste your $. Stick with HP!",1,u23cgfh,2024-02-12T18:16:48-07:00,1.16.0,us

Brother vs HP,This is my second brother printer. I had the first one for almost a decade. Then shifted to HP aa I fell for their clever marketing and a good looking red exterior.  Within a year I got rid of the HP and moved back to Brother.  The Brother printers are more reliable then HP. Especially for wireless printing. I highly recommend this printer over HP,5,Best camera for home security,2024-02-11T03:39:18-07:00,1.16.0,us

Technical Support is Useless,App is stuck on gathering supplies information.  I am not able to print.  Technical support is useless.  So disappointed in Brother for lack of support to fix the problem.,1,papa1450,2024-01-23T10:02:07-07:00,1.16.0,us
Oh Brother!,"Horrible connection issues with iPhone. Never wants to print directly from the phone. Only solution is to add multiple steps in saving docs and printing through the Brother app. Not a tech friendly solution to home printing. Archaic set up with a CD? Manually inputing network info? What is this 2006??? I wanted Brother to be a SMART home solution and I ordered the latest model laser printer. It’s cheap plastic and outdated out of the box. I will be returning. Brother needs to revamp their whole software and connection tools, even their app looks like a Walgreens kiosk from 1999. Sad. They make good good cost effective prints, but at a cost to your sanity.",1,Nikon Warrior,2024-01-21T10:02:02-07:00,1.16.0,us

Connection,This is the second try for me with Brother Printers. I sent the first one back and got an HP. It worked fine. I decided I wanted to try another Brother because I have a Brother Luminaire XP3 and a Scan n Cut SDX325. I thought it would be nice to have a Brother Printer. I have tried everything and I cannot get it to print. I am going to return it. I am tired of wasting hours trying different things. It will not print  with my iPad/iPhone or my laptop.

No control of basic functions,No control of printing size. Prints of photos are partially printed because there’s no fit to paper option. It’s as if it’s printing a billboard. You only get a portion of the photo on standard letter size paper. Seems totally dedicated to marketing laser refills.,1,!!dr,2023-12-13T18:03:58-07:00,1.15.1,us
App is rubbish,"Connectivity is spotty and will stop working if you change the admin password on your brother printer. There is no option to wake the printer if needed. Print jobs get stuck and silently requeue themselves, resulting in enormous amounts of wasted toner, paper and time. Worse, the app never resets the copies count on new print jobs, so oftentimes, I make the mistake of sending 3 or more duplicate prints when I only needed 1. 
Connectivity doesn't work at ALL if the printer and MobileConnect client are attached to different access points, even if they are part of the same WiFi network.",2,wj4,2023-12-09T06:10:39-07:00,1.15.1,us

Print app review,"The app in itself is ok for straightforward A4 printing but it is very limited when it comes to printing multiples as there is no way to put multiple images on one page , which we use a lot in terms of printing references.
Also resizing an image is also very limited , you can only downsize , there is no way to change the image size to make it bigger if you need it.
If it wasn’t for the fact that we can only use the mobile app with our brother printer , I wouldn’t choose this app as it is far too limited in every way",2,DeeTruewill,2024-02-27T06:24:01-07:00,1.16.1,gb

Exactly what I wanted,"Coming from an Xerox Workcentre that kept on jamming and not working on the network, I done the sensible thing and bought a brother laser printer. I have not had one single issue with it since using it for one year.

What I love about this company, is that they seem really fair and this even shows in the software and drivers they make. There's no bloatware, no annoying ads, t-shirt upsells or stupid services... the things that brother make 'just work.

I had one small ad for Brothers toner service which I do not mind at all, especially how reasonably priced it is, and how there's no bloatware. Their toners/ink are very reasonably priced also. I hope this company never change what they are clearly very good at, I respect them highly for not 'doing what everyone else is doing' with adverts and bloatware, and good on them. That's why my next printer will also be a Brother, why I will use Brother Genuine toner and why I will be recommending them to everyone.

Could be more functional,"This is a great app and adds some more functionality than the native iOS print utility. However, I was looking for an app that can print multi-page documents in a booklet format. Although you can print 2 or 4 pages scaled on a single piece of paper and you can specify a range of pages you can’t change the order in which the 
pages print. 

For example: if I had an 8 page document that I wanted in booklet format I would need two pages on each side of the sheet of paper. The cover of the booklet would be pages 8 and 1, and on the opposite side pages 2 and 7 and so on. It seems to me that this would be a simple thing to add to the functionality of this app. I hope they do.",4,J0M023,2022-10-10T10:46:33-07:00,1.8.0,ca

To upgrade this app, it needs an OCR for the scanning option!",4,ellewist1,2022-08-08T17:28:08-07:00,1.7.0,ca
It’s fun to load an APP,"Fun to find out that it is not intuitive friendly. When you scan, the scanner makes noises but, if it scanned, the page disappears into . . . Where? When you have a multi page item to print you must go through 3 or 4 (I lost count) steps to print page 5 only. Not saying it’s bad just saying it is cumbersome and the language used is language a computer wonk would use which is foreign to most people. To print a Safari page was a hit and miss exercise. It doesn’t come up on Apple’s share arrow. Before letting APPs like this fly someone should give it to a few non computer people for whom a computer or iPhone or iPad is a tool, not a career. We want to find and push a button easily and quickly. The Apple's and Brother’s of this world should have a zero star for reviews.",1,Jsponk,2022-07-03T18:50:55-07:00,1.6.0,ca

"Basic functionality works, but scanning experience is frustrating","The app generally does what it’s designed for — I can print, check machine status, and perform basic tasks. However, there are two major issues that really hurt the experience:
	1.	Scanning reliability: Every time I try to scan, the app shows “unable to connect” unless I completely shut down and restart the machine first. It’s strange because I can print from the same app and view the printer’s status, so the connection clearly exists.
	2.	Limited scan editing: After scanning, there’s no option to reorder pages. You can edit or crop, but not rearrange — something my older $60 Canon printer handled effortlessly.

If these two issues are addressed, this would be a solid companion app. For now, it’s functional but far from smooth.",2,BULB232amra612,2025-11-01T16:47:19-07:00,1.21.5,au

Everything is running good but now app is crashing,"After last update app is continuously crashing while showing setting up. I have important documents in app now I don’t know if i delete the app then documents will delete it not. And this app should rename to print utility or brother print etc.
And app should rename to brother print or similar to these so that easy to find.",3,Shubham Jindam,2025-05-02T12:11:37-07:00,1.20.4,in

No option to print odd even pages,Printing odd even pages is useful for manual duplex printing. This is used since before duplex printing was available.,2,bytesandbots,2025-01-23T22:20:52-07:00,1.20.0,in

but could be better.!!,"The app need a lot of improvements ,their are features such as id card scanning and booklet printing of pdf which is missing in the mobile version, which is a feature of the printer. There is a ADF which is one of this printers highlights but there is no option to take a 2 sided scans; like there could have been an option in scan for 2 sided and after one side the person could manually flip the pages and in software it could be rearranged into the final output. And speaking of rearranging there is no facility to rearrange scanned pages; like a drag feature is something that would be really useful. Developer please consider adding these in the next update..!! Other than that the app is pretty great in terms of look and usability.!",2,AshinSanthosh,2024-06-17T11:30:17-07:00,1.18.1,in
New Bugs added with the new update,"Instead removing bugs, the new update added new bugs, now the app can’t even connect to the printer and asks to connect the printer to the same wifi network, even though the printer is connected to the same network. The update has ruined the experience, now i can’t even scan a book peacefully.",1,@21gunherald,2024-04-26T23:46:41-07:00,1.17.0,in

Doesn’t function well on iPhone 13 Pro,"Just changed my iPhone. The app was a charm on older iPhone and connected with the Brother DCP-525W like a charm.  Since changing the mobile the app always shows the printer is offline even when I have pressed the power button on the printer to turn it on. I have to literally delete the app and reinstall the app after which it will function ok for the that particular instance. But once again if a new command is given after some time, the same cycle repeats itself.",1,Bonemaster23,2023-03-24T10:09:01-07:00,1.10.2,in
