Parkinsomnia,"Hadn’t use this app in a long time, but recently rediscovered it due to needing to scan some documents. I didn’t realize just how easily this connects to your HP printer and we’ve had our printer for years so I’m impressed with the backwards compatibility. An even nicer surprise was that I was able to fax a document directly from this app right after scanning it. I just happened to stumble upon that feature after just the day before looking for apps that would allow for free faxing. Very impressed and I like how the scanning feature shows a live updated document while the scan is occurring.",us,2026-01-13T13:06:58-07:00,13630037220,5,Awesome that you can scan and fax!,20.2.0,0,0

TrashCat13,I buy my own HP ink and the printer does not let you use all the ink before it starts printing faded pages. According to the graphic in the app a quarter of the ink is wasted.  Also sometimes after manually adjusting the image and test printing it defaults back to original image not giving me a chance to tweak my adjustment or reprint it.  Having to login to check ink levels or make printer adjustments is inconvenient.  Pop up adds promoting the easy ink program is annoying too. No tutorial after major app updates.  My access to select my photos is buried below other folders so it does not show up on. my screen.  So you have to scroll down to see it.  At first I didn’t know there was other folders below what was on the screen so I could find my photos folder so I didn’t use the iPad app.  It was only after another app update that I noticed upon loading that it showed all the folders then resized to show only a few folders on my screen. so I tried scrolling down and found my photos folder. I’ve had this printer for 5 years and when it breaks down I will be looking at other brands.,us,2026-01-04T13:53:21-07:00,13595241797,3,Works but Needs work,20.2.0,0,0

overpaidEngineer,"If there was a case study on how bad a product can be, this should be one of the fine examples. Here are my findings for future scholars. 
1. Asks for subscriptions one too many times - this is a printer and a scanner, which blocks you from using anything other than their sub-par ink to print anything and you are asked to pay them money every month
2. Why do i need an account to scan my document? There is literally no logical reason to need an account for a scan job. 
3. Scan at 300DPI when my machine supports 1200DPI. Imagine you spent $100 on a high quality camera that can shoot at 48 megapixel, but the app, the only way to take the photo, delivers the product in 12 megapixel. Gameboy camera kit had a better resolution than this joke. 
4. Constantly disconnects after a scan job. Whoever designed the firmware clearly has no business in embedded software engineering if they can’t keep a connection alive. 
5. Apple human interface guideline is ignored in every chance. You guys clearly thought you had better UX than Apple guideline, which isn’t perfect, but light years better than this UX, designed when Germans were still flying overhead",us,2025-12-30T09:57:03-07:00,13573731007,1,All you can do wrong in a product in one,20.2.0,0,0

And it happens not only to be, but to multiple people I work with then when you do go to resize and you get it to the size you want and hit print it’ll reset then you have to go resize it again and hit print again twice and it happens every single time so fix those issues before you’re messing with making the screen black or whatever you want make the right changes.",us,2025-12-22T07:48:59-07:00,13542775596,2,Updates,20.2.0,0,0

Notagameplayer,"this new update made my small business grind to a screeching halt today, for hours!  i had just got started printing out a batch of invoices when suddenly my printer seemed to virtually ‘disappear’ and i could not figure out how to remedy the process.  the print function was disabled and said that there was not a printer available while the app said the printer was awake and all is well.  i finally figured out i had to click on the export icon then select print by app.  by the time it actually starts printing i have made a total of 5 EXTRA clicks.  and then another 4 clicks after the print job is completed before i can start the next.  this has doubled the amount of time i used to take just to print invoices.  one other feature on the newly updated app that i do not see available is the option to increase or decrease the image size.  for example i need to be able to decrease the size from 100% to 90% so that a 2 page print job will fit on 1 page.   and i need to decrease to 75% for my usps postage labels to fit nicely on my packages.  i REALLY NEED this feature and if i can figure out how to connect to the printer w my ipad without this app, i will.  so far all it is doing is pissing me off.",us,2025-12-16T19:06:04-07:00,13522343613,2,i know you think you did good on the recent update…,20.2.0,0,0

Laurenbythesea,I’m not a technophobe I’ve run my own business and used computers and printers all my adult life. The last one stopped working and trying to problem solve it was a night mate in the end I just gave up and bought a new one. It came with free ink. Hp continued to charge me for instant ink despite having not been able to print anything and I figured it made sense to use the free ink I got with it. It also came with a 3 month free instant ink however upon setting up the printer it asks me to setup hp + and today’s that after I do I won’t be able to use instant ink. The whole thing is a confusing mess and not user friendly at all. The app is so glitchy so expect hours to be wasted staring at a loading symbol and getting instantly kicked out and having to constantly re log in to it.

FarmerBarleycorn,"The HP app was terrible to start and, after a brief improvement, it is back to its old terrible form.  Just spent an hour trying to get a document to print, and the only way to get it to work was to delete the app, reinstall it and re add the printer again using its IP address (app didn’t find it automatically). No error or help messages displayed at any point and the printer was listed as available the whole time before I deleted the app.
On top of that, the app now won’t scan from our printer/scanner and you have to create an account with HP to even print!

karah1999,"Do not opt for the HP ink subscription service as you are likely to pay an unexpected  bill, as I was. You get billed for every page you print, even if you did not order any paper, and have not had an ink order in YEARS. You pay just for the act of printing. I couldn’t believe it when I was billed £20.00 for printing a few pages of my OWN paper. The customer “service” is effin useless, too.  Just takes you to a GPT bot and doesn’t offer the option to speak with a real person. I’m afraid this is the last straw with HP, Cancelled my membership and shan’t be returning. 

Take my advice and get the standard ink cartridges. They don’t make it obvious that this is even an option.

batonbrat,"Do not buy the ink subscription! If you cancel your subscription before your ink runs out the ink cartridge, regardless of how much ink is left in it, becomes COMPLETELY useless!

This is the ONLY colour printer I have access to and I can't use it to print Christmas gifts/cards because all I have is 1 subscription cartridge and I can't afford to renew my subscription or buy non subscription ink cartridges!

If I try to print anything all is does it prints out a warning stating ""This printer is not enrolled in HP Instant Ink. To continue using the installed HP Instant Ink cartridge, the printer must be enrolled.""

They market the subscription as a cheaper, more convenient way to get ink but the second you can't renew your subscription you printer essentially becomes an expensive paper weight! And God forbid you use non subscription ink, because a postal strike caused your subscription ink to be severely delayed, cuz the printer throws a fit over that too!

I paid good money for this printer and now it's completely useless! 

I won't be buying HP printers or HP Ink in the future!  I'll be going with a brand that doesn't force subscriptions by rendering a product you OWN completely useless if you end up in a position where you can't give them MORE money than you've already given them!

mohammed0402,i have been using hp smart tank 580 and it take so much time to print even!!! the phone interface doesn't support printer properly and it is very frustrating to print docs.. and the app support is even worse... first it doesn't allow me to login into the app.. I tried several times to login but still it won't let me login.. somehow if i login then after chosing all the option for the printout at last when it comes to the print page it won't let me press the print option!! like what is the use of having the app which is designed for the whole purpose of printing out documents and it can't even do that!! very highly disappointed by printer and the service.,in,2025-11-02T17:11:51-07:00,13349139260,1,The worst interface and the worse service,20.1.0,0,0

ReCyCleR0815,Wirklich Gute App. Warum 4/5 Sterne. Einfach nichts ist perfekt und für meinen Geschmack könnte die App noch ein paar mehr Detailliertere Einstellungen anbieten ähnlich der Windows Applikation.  Zudem könnte man die Einstellungen ggf. Übersichtlicher/Zentraler gestalten. Beispiel beim Scannen befinden sich die Einstellungen auf unterschiedlichen Buttons statt das Menü in Menü zu gestalten. Eine Möglichkeit vermisse ich noch oder habe dies noch nicht gefunden… Wenn man Scannt mit der App und mehrere nicht zusammenhängende Seiten Scannt fehlt mir die Möglichkeit vor dem speichern manuell die Dateien zu trennen so das man mit einem Scann mehrere Dateien speichern kann. Aber dennoch alles was ich bisher gebraucht habe mit Ausnahme des einen was oben beschrieben wurde ist die App Top !,de,2026-01-18T01:42:49-07:00,13647085879,4,Wirklich Gute App mit kleinem Verbessungspotenzial,20.2.0,0,0

BP2309,"Ich nutze die App erst seit ein paar Tagen, aber wenn dann schon um eine Rezension gebeten wird - bitte:
Die Installation des Druckers über die App war nicht ganz intuitiv, ließ sich aber relativ problemlos durchführen. Das Drucken lässt sich gut steuern. Beim Scannen bin ich dann sauer geworden, was aber wohl eher auf die WiFi-Fähigkeit des Druckers (MFP 179 fwg) zurückzuführen ist, der immer wieder die Verbindung ins WLAN verlor, dann zwar tapfer weiterscannte, aber die in der Empfang Pause verarbeiteten Daten schlicht ignorierte bzw. verlor. Der Drucker war also nicht in der Lage, die Daten zu puffern, um diese dann bei der Wiederherstellung der Verbindung diese zu senden. Das ist bei mehrseitigen Scans mehr als ärgerlich. Gefaxt habe ich noch nicht.
Dass ein Drucker unbedingt über eine App gesteuert werden muss finde ich nicht hilfreich, ist aber nun mal heutzutage so.
Überzeugt bin ich also nicht, werde sehen, welche Erfahrungen ich noch sammeln werde - hoffentlich mehr Gutes.",de,2025-12-08T05:04:55-07:00,13489777768,3,Da ist Luft nach oben,20.1.2,0,0

Tatiana Schmidt,"Ich war anfangs sehr begeistert von meinem HP 2700 Series Drucker. Die Einrichtung war einfach und meine Dokumente wurden innerhalb weniger Sekunden sauber gedruckt. Doch seit der Einführung der neuen App ist die Nutzung praktisch unmöglich geworden.

Der Drucker verliert ständig die Verbindung zum Netzwerk. Vor jedem einzelnen Druckauftrag muss ich den Drucker manuell entfernen und wieder neu hinzufügen. Selbst dann dauert es ewig, bis irgendetwas funktioniert, wenn überhaupt. Zusätzlich werden die Seitenränder meiner Dateien nicht mehr korrekt gedruckt, was mir heute sogar ein wichtiges Ereignis ruiniert hat, weil ich ein Dokument nicht rechtzeitig ausdrucken konnte.

Ich habe unzählige Neustarts und Netzwerktests durchgeführt, aber nichts hilft. Die Erfahrung ist extrem frustrierend, und ich bin sehr enttäuscht von der aktuellen Software.

""Numérisez plus intelligemment

Numérisez, enregistrez et partagez des fichiers de n'importe où avec la caméra de votre téléphone. Le rognage automatique et les ajustements de contraste garantissent que chaque numérisation est propre et professionnelle.
Comment faire :
1. Sélectionnez votre imprimante et allez à Numérisation avec caméra.
2. Choisissez le format de numérisation souhaité.

alice sapatireri assolari,"Depois da atualização em que o aplicativo mudou de nome, ele ficou extremamente ruim. O app simplesmente me deslogou e, desde então, não consigo mais entrar. Toda vez aparece que meu login ou minha senha estão inválidos, mesmo eu colocando tudo corretamente. Já tentei diversas vezes, reinstalei, mudei a senha e nada resolve.

Além disso, várias funções que antes eram práticas agora nem chegam a carregar. A experiência piorou demais, parece que o app regrediu em vez de melhorar. Isso já faz tempo e até agora não arrumaram, o que mostra descaso com os usuários.

Antes da atualização o aplicativo era bom, rápido e confiável. Agora está praticamente inutilizável. Muito decepcionante ver um app que funcionava bem se tornar tão problemático depois de uma simples troca de nome e atualização. Espero que corrijam isso logo, porque do jeito que está, é impossível usar.",br,2025-10-30T08:11:07-07:00,13334039353,1,Atualização muito ruim,20.1.0,0,0
