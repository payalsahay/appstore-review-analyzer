I know that it is 15 years old but it has not been used heavily and always with my Android smart phone and that's why I have only just discovered the problem. Although it is old it's in excellent condition and has been fairly reliable. this App can show the printer name and cartridge ink levels but will not connect to the phone via the internet!",

Also, why do I need to login to an HP account to use a 15+ year old device sitting on my own desk? Why can't I scan at 600dpi or greater? Before installing, check to see if your device is supported by the \"Mopria\" app so you can hopefully steer clear of this.",

For example, if I want page 5 only, neither writing 5 or 5-5 prints page 5, and the printer will print page 1. Also, the app has improved from its previous versions, but the printers are buggy, don't wake up when a job is sent, and the cleaning cycles take ages making them useless for quick jobs (officeJet).",
