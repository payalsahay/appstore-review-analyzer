brandonskruse,HP has got to be the worst printer I’ve ever purchased. Not for printing just for problems. It says Wi-Fi connection error every month two weeks out of the month. I forget the network and re-sign in to the Wi-Fi. It still has an error exclamation over the Wi-Fi and does not work. I have to have the printer turned off sometimes for a week straight to get it to reset. Then the HP smart app on Windows cannot will not show that I have the printer connected through USB so I have to download party app to use the scanner because the HP smart app can’t find a plugged in printer to my computer. I will always never recommend an HP printer. Not for quality of print for the inability to print.,us,2026-01-15T11:09:39-07:00,13637192641,1,Lifetime problems,20.2.0,0,0

They even have a package to send back your old used cartridges. The best part is the printer was very inexpensive brand new. I have the HP OfficeJet 5255.

TrashCat13,I buy my own HP ink and the printer does not let you use all the ink before it starts printing faded pages. According to the graphic in the app a quarter of the ink is wasted.  Also sometimes after manually adjusting the image and test printing it defaults back to original image not giving me a chance to tweak my adjustment or reprint it.  Having to login to check ink levels or make printer adjustments is inconvenient.  Pop up adds promoting the easy ink program is annoying too. No tutorial after major app updates.  My access to select my photos is buried below other folders so it does not show up on. my screen.  So you have to scroll down to see it.  At first I didn’t know there was other folders below what was on the screen so I could find my photos folder so I didn’t use the iPad app.  It was only after another app update that I noticed upon loading that it showed all the folders then resized to show only a few folders on my screen. so I tried scrolling down and found my photos folder. I’ve had this printer for 5 years and when it breaks down I will be looking at other brands.,us,2026-01-04T13:53:21-07:00,13595241797,3,Works but Needs work,20.2.0,0,0

Mattmattmattxcfghuyrcee,"Bought an HP business printer a few years ago.  Moderately used.  About 30 days after the warranty was up, it stopped working.  I called them (support is very challenging), and was told they could support but I had to pay a fee just to talk to someone.  Said no thanks and bought another hp printer (out of spite because I’m an idiot).

About 30 days after the warranty was up is stopped connecting and hasn’t worked since.

Almost seems like it’s planned………..",us,2026-01-02T04:37:46-07:00,13585018684,1,Horrible,20.2.0,0,0

Cropping Sucks,This was a great app/program before last update. Now the “Crop” feature has changed and is not easy to manipulate.

I may change out my printer to a different manufacturer due to this issue. I do a lot of scanning and editing and this last update has made cropping unusable for me.  Just disappointing.

overpaidEngineer,"If there was a case study on how bad a product can be, this should be one of the fine examples. Here are my findings for future scholars. 
1. Asks for subscriptions one too many times - this is a printer and a scanner, which blocks you from using anything other than their sub-par ink to print anything and you are asked to pay them money every month
2. Why do i need an account to scan my document? There is literally no logical reason to need an account for a scan job. 
3. Scan at 300DPI when my machine supports 1200DPI. Imagine you spent $100 on a high quality camera that can shoot at 48 megapixel, but the app, the only way to take the photo, delivers the product in 12 megapixel. Gameboy camera kit had a better resolution than this joke. 
4. Constantly disconnects after a scan job. Whoever designed the firmware clearly has no business in embedded software engineering if they can’t keep a connection alive. 
5. Apple human interface guideline is ignored in every chance. You guys clearly thought you had better UX than Apple guideline, which isn’t perfect, but light years better than this UX, designed when Germans were still flying overhead",us,2025-12-30T09:57:03-07:00,13573731007,1,All you can do wrong in a product in one,20.2.0,0,0

So very excited about the things that I can actually do with it. Was definitely worth the money got it on sale for Christmas it’s going to save me money but also the money I would spend on getting them developed now I can put that money toward getting the paper that I need to print my pictures and depending on size the paper it’s self can be pricey but the money that I spend in a month from getting them developed I can buy the photo paper almost 4 time for it to add up what I spend a month on getting them developed it’s my kids I take pics of so of course I’m get them developed because to me that’s memories that I have of my children birthday first day of school whatever got to do it while there young that way I always have the memories of my kids been a certain age or whatever .,us,2025-12-27T01:47:22-07:00,13560253956,5,Works really good so far,20.2.0,0,0

Laurenbythesea,I’m not a technophobe I’ve run my own business and used computers and printers all my adult life. The last one stopped working and trying to problem solve it was a night mate in the end I just gave up and bought a new one. It came with free ink. Hp continued to charge me for instant ink despite having not been able to print anything and I figured it made sense to use the free ink I got with it. It also came with a 3 month free instant ink however upon setting up the printer it asks me to setup hp + and today’s that after I do I won’t be able to use instant ink. The whole thing is a confusing mess and not user friendly at all. The app is so glitchy so expect hours to be wasted staring at a loading symbol and getting instantly kicked out and having to constantly re log in to it.

karah1999,"Do not opt for the HP ink subscription service as you are likely to pay an unexpected  bill, as I was. You get billed for every page you print, even if you did not order any paper, and have not had an ink order in YEARS. You pay just for the act of printing. I couldn’t believe it when I was billed £20.00 for printing a few pages of my OWN paper. The customer “service” is effin useless, too.  Just takes you to a GPT bot and doesn’t offer the option to speak with a real person. I’m afraid this is the last straw with HP, Cancelled my membership and shan’t be returning. 

Take my advice and get the standard ink cartridges. They don’t make it obvious that this is even an option. Once you subscribe to the ink service, you have to remain on the service in order to even use the printer as the ink cartridges are connected to your account. What a joke.

Robert-Dowell,"UPDATE : I had to delete the app and reinstall as it was consuming 50% battery life when the iPad Pro was in standby.  The app has Background activity turned off, (I have it turned off by default for all apps) yet it still manages to be in the background for 8 hours a night and throughout the day.  I have not run the app in a week, and then it suddenly pops up in the battery monitor as a background task running all night and all day.  All AI options for the app are also disabled, yet it still keeps using battery life whilst doing nothing.  So I have had to delete it again. There are also the frequent crashes after scanning, this software is no longer as reliable for making PDFs as it used to be.  HP used to be known for their quality, but not so much now.

I guess I only have myself to blame for trusting them, as this is not the first time that HP have disappointed. For instance, their failure to update the HP 8600 Pro AirPrint drivers back when  iOS 11 was a thing, and yet still they still have not resolved the problem regarding the scaling of printed images.

But this review relates to HP SMART, (Smart is not a word I would use to describe this app though). Whilst scanning lots of images to my iPad Pro, I tried to make them into a PDF.  Unfortunately the software had other ideas and crashed.  When I reopened the app, predictably it no longer had any of the scans I had been working on.  Of course I was less than impressed, after losing 2 hours of work.

The app redesign leaves a lot to be desired.  Like Apple who seem to be having a war against common sense, HP seem to have decided in their Trump like wisdom that Users will know what to do, just because HP designers and engineers do.  Osmosis is not a learning tool, either make things obvious or don't change them.

Additionally, if you have quite a few images in a folder, the app just plan messes around with your files.

1) It will allow you to rename the files, sure, but if you name the image something previously within that directory, it will take the thumbnail from the previous image and overlay it on the new one.  Even if the image is no longer present in the directory.

2) Renaming images with names from old ones also increases the chance that HP Smart will decide to replace your current image with the old name one. This even seems to happen even if the old image has been deleted or is not longer in the directory.  The only work around seems to be to exit the app, kill it in multiswitcher and then reopen it.  Not an ideal solution, as it can lead to problems if you are dealing with over 150 scans in a folder.

3) If you have lots of scans in a folder, in excess of 100, the app will not remember any of the edits you've made to the images.  For instance, if you rotate the image, exit and save your changes, then quit the app and reopen it, the image will have reverted to its old orientation.  This applies to all the cropping and editing tools in the app.

4) The likelihood of Crashing the app, increases as you perform edits on images.  If you edit lots of images after you scan them, it is highly likely to crash loosing all your work.

5) The app has been redesigned, but there is a distinct lack of any hints as to how to do things.  For instance editing an image is a game of hit and miss.  I eventually found that you have to tap the image, but only after poking around and stabbing at things.

6) To top it all, if you turn off iCloud Sync, but choose to keep all the files you've scanned on your iPad, it has other ideas and deletes all files it has stored locally.  Don't even try and turn it back on as all files will be gone.  In other words, scan things and immediately extract them from the App, as HP CAN NOT be trusted to handle data.

Again not a stellar performance and not what I would have expected from HP.  The only thing this app is good for now is a gateway to scanning.  Forget the editing tools or anything else it supports, it is not currently worth the effort of wading through the bugs.

I give the App 1 star as it is able to load and scan, but as for the rest . . .",gb,2025-08-13T17:15:12-07:00,13012761216,1,What's with the ZOMBIE app HP.,18.10.1,1,1

batonbrat,"Do not buy the ink subscription! If you cancel your subscription before your ink runs out the ink cartridge, regardless of how much ink is left in it, becomes COMPLETELY useless!

This is the ONLY colour printer I have access to and I can't use it to print Christmas gifts/cards because all I have is 1 subscription cartridge and I can't afford to renew my subscription or buy non subscription ink cartridges!

If I try to print anything all is does it prints out a warning stating ""This printer is not enrolled in HP Instant Ink. To continue using the installed HP Instant Ink cartridge, the printer must be enrolled.""

They market the subscription as a cheaper, more convenient way to get ink but the second you can't renew your subscription you printer essentially becomes an expensive paper weight! And God forbid you use non subscription ink, because a postal strike caused your subscription ink to be severely delayed, cuz the printer throws a fit over that too!

I paid good money for this printer and now it's completely useless! 

I won't be buying HP printers or HP Ink in the future!  I'll be going with a brand that doesn't force subscriptions by rendering a product you OWN completely useless if you end up in a position where you can't give them MORE money than you've already given them!

It goes offline at random (while everything else in the house works just fine). There is no option to scale images up or down, so if I want a 5x7"" image, I have to use 5x7"" paper. If I want a 4x6"" image, I need to use 4x6"" paper. What the heck? I had to re-register the bloody printer when I installed new cartridges. And the menu bar options are so basic that NOWHERE is there helpful information. Yes, it'll print a basic document very well. Beyond that?

kusssshhh,"Hmm. Not sure why you needed to add so many redundant steps to the printing process, but my business isn’t happy with how long I have to “redo” the wifi connections to print. Your software has suffered. 

My client has been staring at me now for an hour. I just downloaded a new software I’ve never seen before, that automatically prints instructions on how to perform the steps THAT I JUST PERFORMED. 

If I have to get wifi instructions printed every-TIME I connect this HP, then I’m not sure if I want this brand anymore within my business. I need my equipment to do what I need it to do, when I need to do it, and we don’t need printers in our premises that suddenly change how they operate (at random intervals). I don’t feel like setting up this printer over and over (and over) in such a remedial, redundant and inefficient way. 

Your software is (now) abysmal. The fiscal and technical reasons for this direction in your company is escaping me. In my opinion this is a now a very substandard software; we are removing the rest of these printers from our premises as we speak.

Roo to you,"So easy to use and the print and scan quality is excellent! My HP SMART TANK 7305, is the best printer I have  ever owned, it’s for home use however I have used HP, including large format printing for my business for 16 years, always extremely reliable and easy to use, and excellent value for what they are capable off!

However this printer with its 2 years supply if inks for just over $100 dollars is amazing value, the ink seems endless and never runs out, the print and scan quality is excellent, the best I have owned in over 20 years, I love my HP Printer, and that’s about, get yourself one! 

I promise you will not be disappointed in any way with this printer, it’s just unbelievable, I love, love it :)

Sven Viking,"Normally slow with long delays, and relatively often it freezes up entirely and needs to be restarted. Sometimes the printer itself needs to be restarted.

Requires you to reenter a pin from the bottom of the printer each and every time you want to change basic settings, but if you don’t enter the pin within a few seconds it switches to a failure screen.

If the printer is going mad printing things you don’t want, there’s no obvious way to find a print queue and cancel everything (or cancel everything on the printer itself).

Sends iOS notifications reading only “null”.

Gives you a one-time ultimatum where you need to choose between access to certain online features or the ability to print while your Internet is down, and apparently there’s no way to reverse this decision.",au,2025-04-15T15:27:46-07:00,12547743144,1,Unfortunately glitchy,18.5.1,0,0

The fact that they can stop me scanning and printing when I already own the ink when my credit card expired (the standard periodic update)  is beyond belief.

Everything opens as an external link in a browser - from checking printer ink levels to getting your notifications. You may as well just use the website. What’s the point of having an app?
The final straw was trying to change my shipping address for the ink. Account management opens as an in-app browser, which then asks you to log in, which then reloads the page, which then asks you to log in - a constant death loop.

I genuinely not writing a review at all, but just wanted to raise awareness of how bad hp server like.
The app or hp service is extremely slow.

I am not an active subscriber to printing plan, so I wanted to signup whenever I wanted to print, hp made it so complicated and the hp server (including hp smart app and hp official site) was VERY slow. Sometimes, it took me going in circle between the app and the website. 
I’m done with this headache and not to mention it charged me twice (including my previous months which I cancelled).

The app doesn’t help either as it is connected to the printer, says every thinks ready. But when trying to print, has yet another error and the printer does nothing.

BK-0123,"This is an excellent App. 

This App however, consumes great deal of battery power on cellphone. In fact it has the highest consumption of battery amongst all the Apps installed on my cellphone. 

The developers probably presume that there is un-ending battery power available at their disposal. Continued background activity, even when not in use, is probably the culprit. 

Very poor battery management is probably the reason to avoid this App.",in,2024-08-22T09:30:16-07:00,11640340364,2,Brijesh Kumar,17.20.1,0,0

Jesim Ali,"have been using the HP Smart app for a few months now, and it has completely transformed my printing experience. The app is incredibly user-friendly, making it easy to set up and connect my printer in just a few minutes. I love the intuitive interface, which allows me to print, scan, and manage my documents seamlessly from my smartphone or tablet.

One of the standout features for me is the ability to print directly from my cloud storage accounts like Google Drive and Dropbox. This integration has saved me so much time and hassle. The scanning function is equally impressive, providing high-quality scans that I can easily save or share right from the app.

The HP Smart app also includes useful tools like the print preview and photo editing options, which have been great for getting my photos just right before printing. Additionally, the app’s Instant Ink subscription service ensures I never run out of ink, which is a huge convenience.

Overall, the HP Smart app offers a reliable and efficient solution for all my printing needs. It’s clear that a lot of thought has gone into its design and functionality, making it a must-have for anyone with an HP printer.

Die Installation des Druckers über die App war nicht ganz intuitiv, ließ sich aber relativ problemlos durchführen. Das Drucken lässt sich gut steuern. Beim Scannen bin ich dann sauer geworden, was aber wohl eher auf die WiFi-Fähigkeit des Druckers (MFP 179 fwg) zurückzuführen ist, der immer wieder die Verbindung ins WLAN verlor, dann zwar tapfer weiterscannte, aber die in der Empfang Pause verarbeiteten Daten schlicht ignorierte bzw. verlor. Der Drucker war also nicht in der Lage, die Daten zu puffern, um diese dann bei der Wiederherstellung der Verbindung diese zu senden. Das ist bei mehrseitigen Scans mehr als ärgerlich. Gefaxt habe ich noch nicht.
Dass ein Drucker unbedingt über eine App gesteuert werden muss finde ich nicht hilfreich, ist aber nun mal heutzutage so.

Tatiana Schmidt,"Ich war anfangs sehr begeistert von meinem HP 2700 Series Drucker. Die Einrichtung war einfach und meine Dokumente wurden innerhalb weniger Sekunden sauber gedruckt. Doch seit der Einführung der neuen App ist die Nutzung praktisch unmöglich geworden.

Der Drucker verliert ständig die Verbindung zum Netzwerk. Vor jedem einzelnen Druckauftrag muss ich den Drucker manuell entfernen und wieder neu hinzufügen. Selbst dann dauert es ewig, bis irgendetwas funktioniert, wenn überhaupt. Zusätzlich werden die Seitenränder meiner Dateien nicht mehr korrekt gedruckt, was mir heute sogar ein wichtiges Ereignis ruiniert hat, weil ich ein Dokument nicht rechtzeitig ausdrucken konnte.

Roman Mok.,"Die HP Smart App für iOS ist grundsätzlich eine solide und benutzerfreundliche Anwendung, mit der sich HP-Drucker problemlos einrichten und bedienen lassen. Die Verbindung zwischen Mobilgerät und Drucker erfolgt in der Regel schnell und zuverlässig. Besonders positiv hervorzuheben ist die einfache Bedienoberfläche, die es auch technisch weniger versierten Nutzern ermöglicht, Druck-, Scan- oder Kopiervorgänge ohne größere Schwierigkeiten durchzuführen.

Trotz dieser Vorteile weist die App jedoch einige erhebliche Mängel auf, die das Nutzungserlebnis deutlich beeinträchtigen. Insbesondere beim Scannen fehlt die Möglichkeit, benutzerdefinierte Einstellungen vorzunehmen. So ist es beispielsweise nicht möglich, Maßeinheiten oder exakte Zahlenwerte für die Seitengröße manuell einzugeben. Diese Einschränkung reduziert die Flexibilität erheblich – insbesondere für Nutzer, die präzise Formate oder spezielle Scanvorgaben benötigen.

Ein weiterer Kritikpunkt betrifft die Versionen der App für Windows und macOS. Hier kommt es regelmäßig zu Problemen mit hängenden Druckaufträgen. Diese bleiben häufig in der Warteschlange stecken, was die weitere Nutzung des Druckers blockiert. In vielen Fällen hilft nur ein vollständiges Ausschalten und erneutes Einschalten des Druckers, um den Fehler zu beheben – ein umständlicher und zeitraubender Vorgang, der in einer professionellen Umgebung kaum akzeptabel ist.

Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen: Die HP Smart App erfüllt im Alltag grundlegende Aufgaben zuverlässig, weist jedoch bei erweiterten Funktionen und in der Stabilität der Desktop-Versionen gravierende Schwächen auf. Eine gezielte Weiterentwicklung insbesondere im Bereich der benutzerdefinierten Scanoptionen sowie der Druckauftragsverwaltung wäre dringend wünschenswert.",de,2025-05-19T00:01:26-07:00,12672636075,3,HP Color LaserJet Pro MFP 3302fdwg,18.10.1,0,0

alice sapatireri assolari,"Depois da atualização em que o aplicativo mudou de nome, ele ficou extremamente ruim. O app simplesmente me deslogou e, desde então, não consigo mais entrar. Toda vez aparece que meu login ou minha senha estão inválidos, mesmo eu colocando tudo corretamente. Já tentei diversas vezes, reinstalei, mudei a senha e nada resolve.

Além disso, várias funções que antes eram práticas agora nem chegam a carregar. A experiência piorou demais, parece que o app regrediu em vez de melhorar. Isso já faz tempo e até agora não arrumaram, o que mostra descaso com os usuários.

Antes da atualização o aplicativo era bom, rápido e confiável. Agora está praticamente inutilizável. Muito decepcionante ver um app que funcionava bem se tornar tão problemático depois de uma simples troca de nome e atualização.

Maxi.col,"Buenos días,

La impresora está bien pero:
1.No permite la conexión a otros ordenadores y/o móviles, solo funciona con uno.
2.Si los cartuchos están a mitad pero no imprimen bien no se activa el cambio: he pagado mensualmente el servicio, años, sin ver repuestos.
3.He pedido cartuchos sin éxito.

Así que: la máquina en si funciona bien, los servicios de instalcion, conexión y mantenimiento pues, no son recomendables.

Un saludo.

"ra139""","La primera hp daba errores al imprimir, ya que los márgenes de página se aumentaban y el texto sale muy pequeño. Probé en otras impresoras y solo pasaba con esta. También intentaron ayudarme desde el servicio técnico, sin saber porque pasaba. Además se conectaba mal y para imprimir documentos en PDF tengo que descargármelo primero todo, por lo que no es buena impresora si manejas un gran número de documentos y trabajas desde la nube. Al final me cambiaron la impresora. Esta segunda impresora me llega sin cable. Ya solucionado, ya puedo conectarla al enchufe. Resulta que ahora los Word los imprime mal, es decir, me imprime una cara como si imprimiera dos hojas, por lo que sale hipermegapequeño el texto. Ahora tengo q estar pasando todo a PDF,documento a documento, tras haberlo descargado claro. Bueno, lo nuevo, NO ME DEJA A IMPRIMIR A DOBLE CARA.

Roger Review ES,"El modelo de suscripción te compromete a pagos recurrentes sin que estos cumplan su único cometido, que es el buen funcionamiento y disponibilidad de tinta para la impresora. En cambio, se aseguran de que si no es bajo sus ""condiciones"", la impresora quede totalmente inutilizada. Además, pretenden cobrar por hoja, no por la cantidad de tinta utilizada (la correlación se da a su favor).

En otras palabras, es un servicio de impresión bajo demanda en el que tienes que pagar por la impresora, el mantenimiento y, además, la espera. La rentabilidad que obtienen así es enorme, asegurándose pagos recurrentes (lo que les brinda un considerable cashflow) y creando barreras para la competencia, a costa del consumidor. 

No es inteligente. Lo inteligente sería encubrir la cuota mensual como un servicio de mantenimiento en línea, dar la impresora ""gratis"" y, ofrecer además, la cantidad de tinta necesaria.",es,2024-05-03T12:27:15-07:00,11228608840,1,Estafa,17.11.1,0,0

Barski j,"Op een gemaakte manier producten moeilijker maken dan nodig, verdient eigelijk geen ster. Wat jammer dat een simpel product wordt uitgemolken tot een gecompliceerd onding, waardoor het apparaat veranderd in een schaduw van wat het had moeten zijn. Ik zie een printer-scanner, ik ervaar een onnodig tijd verspillend ict project. Een app om het product te gebruiken via je telefoon en wifi prima. Een modern apparaat dat niet als ‘failsafe’ bekabeling heeft is kwalijk. Samenvattend; app werkt beroerd, onnodig ingewikkeld en te veel ingesteld op de consument ‘overcommited’ maken aan het hp ecosysteem. De gekoppelde printer, in mijn geval de hp deskjet 2721e zal vast een prima apparaat zijn als ik het met een optionele kabel aan de computer kan koppelen en op het knopje PRINTEN of SCANNEN klik. Kan het apparaat niet. Vies. Bah. Oja tevens het verplichten van een app, en daarmee dus al mijn documenten door het bijbehorende ecosysteem te pushen waardoor je wel blind vertrouwen moet hebben in het bedrijf waar je documenten doorheen gaan, vind ik eng. Ik geloof op veiligheidsgebied niet in kwaadwilligheid van hp, maar des te minder bedrijven in en om mijn documenten, des te beter.

App developer needs to put in more thought into ensuring that users have access to the full functions of the printer via the app. If not, user has to spent an inordinate amount of time performing task that are not required. For example, making us take 30 mins to scan a 50-page document (double-sided) when it could have been done in 3 mins.  

Really hope HP would fix this issue ASAP. Or else, please don’t call this app ‘HP Smart’ because to many users it is simply ‘HP Stupid’.",sg,2024-05-30T00:14:17-07:00,11322799999,1,App requires more thought in matching its functions with the printer,17.15.1,0,0

Dar321,"Today I was rushing to print documents for my appointment. To my horror, my printer was taken off from my app and they paused my account as now they have this stupid subscription model. I had to make payment before I can continue printing. I hardly print and I haven’t even used 90% of my starter ink (that comes with the printer) and I have to start paying for new ones. What a scam.
